# Trackside Labs

Trackside Labs is an F1 race-weekend prediction system for the 2026 regulation
reset. It produces checkpointed qualifying and race forecasts, then updates them
as practice, qualifying, sprint, and race data arrives.

The hard part is not running a simulation. The hard part is deciding how much to
trust each source of evidence when the car concept has just changed and the
season has almost no current data. A 2025 baseline is useful, but stale. Testing
is current, but teams hide pace. Friday practice is fresh, but noisy. The system
is built around that tradeoff.

## Current Model Work

Active model version: `3.0`.

Version `3.0` is a mechanism change rather than a recalibration: the finish-order
blend no longer discards a correct simulation, and the overtaking calibration work
is complete. See `docs/MODEL_LEDGER.md` for the adoption entry and
`docs/OVERTAKING_CALIBRATION_PLAN.md` for the shipped scope.

Current release posture:

- keep the champion model active for production predictions
- reduce FP/checkpoint overreaction after the first 7 completed race weekends
- score separate targets for main qualifying, Grand Prix race, sprint qualifying,
  and sprint race
- record shadow challengers in saved prediction artifacts for offline review
- require production readiness and challenger audits before any promotion
- revisit challenger promotion only after races 8, 9, and 10 add enough evidence

The main modeling risk being tracked is that recent 2026 data shows PRE forecasts
often outperform later FP-backed checkpoints. The `2.3` tuning keeps practice
evidence useful but bounded, while the challenger audit tests whether recent
actual form should earn target-specific weight.

## Prediction Problem

At race 1, the model has three days of pre-season testing and no 2026 race
results. After seven completed weekends, it has testing, race outcomes,
practice, qualifying, sprint, and replay evidence, but still only a small live
sample. The model has to behave sensibly at both ends of that range.

Main modelling constraints:

- Pre-season testing is directional evidence, not ground truth. Fuel load,
  engine mode, run plan, and sandbagging all matter.
- The blend must move quickly from stale priors toward current-season results.
- Compound performance is circuit-specific and is only used once there are
  enough laps for that compound and team.
- Rookie and missing-driver cases fall back to a team baseline with added
  uncertainty.
- Predictions need to refresh after each session without making the dashboard
  slow for users.

## How The Model Works

Team strength is blended from three signals:

```text
blended_strength = w_baseline * baseline
                 + w_testing * testing_modifier
                 + w_current * current_season_mean
```

The active reset-year schedule is intentionally aggressive:

| Race | Baseline | Testing | Current |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| 1    | 35%      | 20%     | 45%     |
| 2    | 20%      | 10%     | 70%     |
| 3    | 8%       | 5%      | 87%     |
| 4+   | 5%       | 0%      | 95%     |

Before current-season races exist, the current-season term falls back to the
baseline rather than zero.

### Qualifying

Qualifying prediction combines team strength, available session pace, driver
skill, and uncertainty:

```text
team strength
session pace from available FP or sprint sessions
confidence-scaled session weight
driver skill adjustment
Monte Carlo simulation
median grid position and interval
```

Normal weekends weight FP3 most heavily, then FP2 and FP1. Sprint weekends use
sprint qualifying, FP1, and sprint evidence when those sessions exist. If no
session data is available, the model runs from priors only.

### Race

Race prediction starts from the actual or predicted grid, then runs a lap-level
simulation:

```text
grid position
historical overtaking difficulty for the circuit
compound strengths from session history
pit strategy sampling
lap-by-lap tire degradation and fuel effect
traffic and clean-air adjustments
track-specific pit loss
safety car, lap-1, and DNF events
finish order and probability table
```

Each race forecast currently uses 300 Monte Carlo runs. Outputs include finish
order, strategy distribution, podium probability, and uncertainty bands.

### Learning

After a race, the system updates driver error state and teammate-gap calibration
from actual results. Those adjustments feed the next prediction cycle.

Learning is gated. Retrospective runs, duplicate run IDs, missing actuals, and
tiny actual overlaps are skipped so the model does not train on partial or
contaminated records.

## Runtime Design

The dashboard request path is read-only. Artifact generation runs in background
workers:

- `scripts/warmup_precompute.py`: checkpoint-aware warmup used in production
- `scripts/run_session_automation.py`: post-session updates and actuals
- `scripts/update_from_race.py`: manual race update trigger
- `scripts/update_from_testing.py`: manual testing and practice directionality update

Artifacts are read and written through `ArtifactStore`.

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `file_only` | Local JSON only |
| `fallback` | DB-first read, file fallback |
| `dual_write` | Write file and DB during migration |
| `db_only` | Supabase only |

## Evaluation

The system stores predictions at each checkpoint and compares them with actuals
after sessions complete. Accuracy is tracked by target and checkpoint:

- main qualifying
- Grand Prix race
- sprint qualifying
- sprint race

The evaluation bundle is written to:

- `docs/MODEL_CALIBRATION.md`
- `docs/MODEL_ERROR_ANALYSIS.md`

It covers interval calibration, segment breakdowns, systematic bias, baseline
comparison, error analysis, and promotion gates for experimental components.
Machine-readable readiness is emitted in `production_gate` with status, score,
blocking reasons, and metrics.

Regenerate the report after new races complete:

```bash
make evaluation-gate
make candidate-audit
make shadow-challenger-audit
```

## Quick Start

Runtime target: Python 3.11.x

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

For local development:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Generate predictions for an upcoming weekend:

```bash
python scripts/warmup_precompute.py --year 2026
```

Update from the most recent race:

```bash
python scripts/update_from_race.py "Bahrain Grand Prix" --year 2026
```

Run the local pre-commit parity gate:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

Run the focused product-quality suite:

```bash
make lint
make typecheck
make test-focused
make evaluation-gate
```

The full local pytest collection is split for predictable runtime:

```bash
make test-github-chunk-a
make test-github-chunk-b
make test-github-chunk-c
make test-github-chunk-q
make test-github-chunk-r
make test-github-chunk-s
