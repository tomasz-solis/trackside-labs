# Model calibration report, 2026 season

*Generated: 2026-06-16T19:46:42.011345+00:00*

Checks three things: are the uncertainty intervals honest, is the model biased
for or against any driver or team, and does it beat a naive baseline.

Built from saved forecasts by `scripts/generate_evaluation_report.py`. Re-run
after each race.

## 2. Confidence Interval Calibration (Qualifying)

Each driver gets a p5 to p95 position interval. About 90% of actual results
should land inside it.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Races with interval data | 7 |
| Driver-race predictions covered | 154 |
| Nominal coverage (target) | 90.0% |
| Empirical coverage (actual) | 90.3% |
| Calibration error | 0.00 (+0.3%) |
| Mean interval width | 9.63 positions |

OK Well-calibrated (within 3% of nominal).

Negative calibration error: intervals too narrow (overconfident).
Positive: intervals too wide.

## 4. Systematic Bias

Signed error = predicted position - actual position.
Negative = model predicted *better* than reality (overestimated the driver).
Positive = model predicted *worse* than reality (underestimated the driver).

### Qualifying

**Most overestimated teams:**
- Williams: mean signed error -1.50 (MAE 4.50, n=14)
- Ferrari: mean signed error -1.29 (MAE 2.14, n=14)

## 5. Baseline Comparison

Naive baseline: predict race N using the actual results of race N-1
(previous-race classification). No model, just last week's result.

### Qualifying

Based on 6 races.

| Metric | Model | Naive baseline | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| MAE | 2.86 | 2.98 | 0.12 |
| Within-3 rate | 68.2% | 62.9% | - |
| Spearman rho | 0.82 | 0.81 | 0.01 |
| Kendall tau | 0.66 | 0.63 | 0.02 |

OK Model beats naive baseline on MAE

### Race

Based on 6 races.

| Metric | Model | Naive baseline | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| MAE | 3.98 | 4.50 | 0.52 |
| Within-3 rate | 56.8% | 56.1% | - |
| Spearman rho | 0.62 | 0.51 | 0.11 |
| Kendall tau | 0.48 | 0.38 | 0.10 |

OK Model beats naive baseline on MAE

## Notes

- Calibration data populates only for predictions generated after
  p5/p95 interval persistence was added. Older artifacts carry no band data.
- Segment breakdowns slice the same event-level metrics by weekend format, weather,
  and track type using saved metadata and local track characteristics.
- Error analysis highlights the worst weekends and repeat offenders, not just mean scores.
- Systematic bias analysis requires >= 2 races with saved actuals.
- Baseline comparison requires >= 2 races (first race has no predecessor).
- For known model limitations see [LIMITATIONS.md](../LIMITATIONS.md).
