# Model Ledger

What has been tried, how it was measured, and whether it helped.

`MODEL_PROMOTION.md` defines the gates a change must pass. This file is the
record of what actually went through them, kept so the current model's
reliability can be judged over time rather than re-argued from memory. Append to
it; do not rewrite past entries when a later result contradicts them — supersede
them and say so.

## How to read a verdict

| verdict | meaning |
|---|---|
| `adopted` | measured better, now part of champion |
| `worse` | measured, lost |
| `noise` | measured, difference indistinguishable from run-to-run variation |
| `unresolvable` | effect is smaller than the measured seed floor — **nothing was learned** |
| `never activated` | ran, but a runtime guard made it champion-identical — **untested, not neutral** |
| `refused` | could not produce a scored result at all |
| `open` | not yet measured |

`never activated` is the one that misleads. A variant that returns
champion-identical numbers looks harmless in a comparison table and is actually
a variant nobody has tested.

`unresolvable` is the one added 2026-09-12, and it is **not** a synonym for
`noise`. `noise` says the effect straddles zero across events. `unresolvable`
says the effect is smaller than what changing the random seed alone does, so the
comparison could not have detected it either way. Measured on 2026-09-12, a
qualifying MAE change under ~0.045 positions and a race MAE change under ~0.087
are both unresolvable on a single seed pair — which covers a good number of the
deltas recorded in this file. See **Measurement protocol** for the floor and for
how to produce one.

## The baseline problem

**Every result is only comparable to the champion it was measured against.**
On 2026-07-28 a bug fix moved champion qualifying MAE by 0.70 positions —
roughly ten times the largest challenger effect ever recorded here. Any
challenger scored before that date was scored against a champion that no longer
exists.

So every entry below records its baseline. When champion changes materially,
past challenger verdicts become stale rather than wrong, and re-baselining is
the only way to keep the table meaningful.

## Champion history

| date | change | measured effect | commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-28 | Centre `quali_rating_mu_s` within team when the qualifying driver list is built. It was carrying a team-level component on top of the team-strength term, so car pace was counted twice. | qualifying MAE **3.525 → 2.828**; mean per-driver \|bias\| **2.889 → 1.677**. HUL +6.11 → +1.67, ALB −5.78 → +0.11, GAS +4.33 → +0.33 | `93bfbeb0` |

| 2026-08-04 | Refit `team_strength_seconds_mapping` on **2026 only**. It was fitted on 2022–2025 and had never seen a 2026 lap, so it converted team-strength rank into a time gap using a pre-regulation field and compressed team separation all season. | qualifying MAE **2.6599 → 2.5724**, mean per-driver \|bias\| **1.5017 → 1.2997**; race MAE **4.0606 → 3.9192**, race \|bias\| **2.4242 → 2.3434**, both at 60 simulations. Slopes: qualifying 1.77417 → 2.76281, race 1.97077 → 3.89727 | `fdf7be6f` |

Known residual after that change, measured the same way: SAI −5.67, LAW +6.44,
BOR +4.44, ALO −4.11, VER −4.11. These are team-strength errors (Williams
over-rated, RB under-rated), not driver-rating errors, and the centering fix
does not touch them.

## Measurement protocol

**Superseded 2026-09-12.** The protocol previously documented here prescribed
`scripts/run_challenger_research_walk_forward.py` with 3 seeds from
`DEFAULT_REPLAY_SEEDS`. **That script, that constant, and two of the data paths it
named no longer exist** — verified 2026-09-12: `DEFAULT_REPLAY_SEEDS` appears in zero
Python files, and `data/historical_replay/2026/prediction_cache` and
`research_backend_state/` are both gone. Every other script named in this file and in
`MODEL_PROMOTION.md` still exists, so this was one rotted section, not general drift.

This matters more than a stale path. The rule that made results trustworthy — **score
across 3 seeds** — pointed at a harness nobody could run, so work fell back to
`scripts/replay_historical_checkpoints.py`, which until 2026-09-12 had **no seed
support at all** and always ran seed 42. Every verdict produced that way rests on one
draw of the simulator's randomness. The old protocol text is preserved below for
reading old entries; do not try to run it.

### Current protocol

Rebuild the season from preseason, change one thing, score on 2026 only (see the
regulation-break rule), and before adopting anything try to reproduce the gain by
scaling a shipped constant.

```bash
# baseline and candidate, one variable apart
uv run python scripts/replay_historical_checkpoints.py --year 2026 --overwrite \
  --output-root data/historical_replay_baseline
uv run python scripts/replay_historical_checkpoints.py --year 2026 --overwrite \
  --output-root data/historical_replay_candidate

# the seed floor: identical code, two seeds
uv run python scripts/replay_historical_checkpoints.py --year 2026 --overwrite \
  --seed 43 --output-root data/historical_replay_seed43

# compare, gated against that floor
uv run python scripts/compare_replay_arms.py \
  --baseline data/historical_replay_baseline \
  --seed-floor data/historical_replay_baseline data/historical_replay_seed43 \
  --candidate data/historical_replay_candidate
```

**Correlation is the primary metric; MAE is secondary.** Measured 2026-09-12 over 46
checkpoints, resolving power as the 95% CI half-width on a paired delta divided by the
metric's own spread — lower is a finer instrument:

| metric | detectable / spread |
|---|---|
| **correlation** | **0.030** |
| overall_mae | 0.063 |
| top_3_pct | 0.076 |
| within_3 | 0.093 |
| top_10_pct | 0.160 |
| within_1 | 0.172 |
| exact_accuracy | 0.266 |

Correlation resolves about twice as finely as MAE and its aggregate is seed-stable
(shifts 0.0007 when only the seed changes) while still responding on 41 of 46
checkpoints. MAE is also discretised to integer positions: in one real comparison,
**7 of 46 checkpoints had different predicted orders and identical MAE**, so MAE
silently reports "tied" for changes that happened.

**Always pass `--seed-floor`.** Without it `compare_replay_arms.py` warns and refuses
to emit `unresolvable`, because a delta cannot be separated from seed noise without
measuring that noise. The floor threshold is the widest absolute bound of the seed
pair's confidence interval, not its point estimate: one seed pair's shift is a single
draw, and gating on it alone lets noise-sized effects through as real.

**Seed floor measured 2026-09-12** (identical code, seed 42 vs 43, 13 rounds):

| target | metric | mean delta | 95% CI |
|---|---|---|---|
| qualifying | overall_mae | -0.0122 | [-0.0439, +0.0187] |
| qualifying | correlation | -0.0007 | [-0.0039, +0.0024] |
| race | overall_mae | +0.0342 | [-0.0184, +0.0868] |
| race | correlation | -0.0009 | [-0.0076, +0.0059] |
| sprint race | overall_mae | -0.0251 | [-0.1163, +0.0609] |

**So a qualifying MAE change smaller than about 0.045 positions, or a race MAE change
smaller than about 0.087, is not resolvable on a single seed pair.** Several adopted
changes in this file are smaller than that. Re-measure before relying on them.

`compare_replay_arms.py` reports four verdicts, and the last two are not the same thing:

- `better` / `worse` — CI excludes zero and clears the seed floor
- `noise` — CI includes zero
- `unresolvable (below seed floor)` — the effect is smaller than seed randomness; **nothing was learned**
- `identical (never activated)` — every checkpoint tied, so the two runs produced the same predictions; the change **provably did nothing**, which is a finding, not a failed measurement

### Superseded protocol, for reading pre-2026-09-12 entries

The walk-forward entries below used: 9 events from
`data/historical_replay/2026/event_catalog.json` of which 7 scored (two wet rounds
excluded by `dry_only`); checkpoint `PRE`; 3 seeds from `DEFAULT_REPLAY_SEEDS`; 20
qualifying and 20 race simulations; run through
`scripts/run_challenger_research_walk_forward.py` with `--run-tag`. Champion-side
entries were measured directly through
`predict_qualifying(..., practice_signal_mode="stored_profiles")` over all 9 catalog
events against `actual_qualifying_grid`. That path required moving
`data/historical_replay/2026/prediction_cache` aside first, because its
`_source_digest` key covered event data and simulation counts but not code version.


## Challengers tested

All rows below were measured 2026-07-19/20 against the **pre-centering
champion**. Re-baselining against `93bfbeb0` has not been done — see "Blocked"
at the end for why.

| variant | thesis | verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `q0_driver_state` | richer driver-state term for qualifying | **worse** | quali grid MAE mean delta **+0.19**, 1 better / 5 worse |
| `q0_driver_state__baseline500` | q0, 500-sim baseline | **worse** | +0.24, 2 better / 13 worse |
| `q0_driver_state__fp_hisim2` | q0, higher FP sim count | **worse** | +0.23, 2 better / 7 worse |
| `q0_driver_state__pullcap025` | q0, cumulative pull cap 0.25 | **worse** | +0.24, 2 better / 13 worse |
| `q0_driver_state__pullcap035` | q0, cumulative pull cap 0.35 | **worse** | +0.24, 2 better / 13 worse |
| `r1_joint_grid` | sample race grid from the joint qualifying distribution instead of the marginal order | **noise** | end-to-end race MAE **−0.074**, but 4 better / 3 worse over 7 events |
| `r1_joint_grid__fp_hisim2` | as above, higher sim count | **noise** | 5 better / 4 worse, mean delta 0.000 |
| `q1_qualifying_practice` | practice one-lap pace → qualifying potential | **never activated** | manifest status `refused` ("no eligible scored events") because the research fit needs 4 prior dry same-class events and had 3; the `q1_retro` run that did produce output was champion-identical, disclosing `no_raw_practice_laps` |
| `r0_long_run` | practice long-run pace → race pace | **never activated** | 42 structural-identity flags, `missing_race_practice_evidence` |
| `r0_long_run__fp_hisim2` | as above | **never activated** | 60 structural-identity flags, `insufficient_field_evidence_coverage` |
| `r2_no_anchor`, `r1_r2_no_anchor` | grid-anchor variants | **refused** | `finish_order` invalid: a position fell outside its own p5–p95 interval |
| `r2_source_anchor`, `r1_r2_source_anchor` | grid-anchor variants | **refused** | no eligible scored events |

Across every run: 309 champion-vs-challenger metric pairs, 179 identical, 130
differing. **Nothing beat champion.**

Q0 is the clearest result — it lost under all four tunings, so it is not a knob
that needs turning.

### What this does and does not tell you

Q1 and R0 are the two variants that match the actual modeling thesis: one-lap
pace drives qualifying, long-run pace drives the race. Neither has ever run.
The replay harness feeds `practice_signal_mode="stored_profiles"`, so
`session_laps_by_type = {}` by construction and both variants hit a runtime
guard and return champion-identical output.

So the honest summary is not "practice-driven variants do not help". It is
**"the grid-plumbing variants were tested and lost; the practice-driven
variants have never been tested."**

`docs/RAW_LAPS_REPLAY_HANDOFF.md` is the fix and was already the stated priority
on 2026-07-19.

## Blocked

Re-running the three scoring variants against the fixed champion was attempted
and stopped. The challenger modules were written against production code that no
longer exists in this repo, and clearing one blocker only reveals the next:

| gap | outcome |
|---|---|
| `predict_qualifying(include_grid_scenarios=)` | implemented, then reverted with the shelving |
| `predict_qualifying(include_challenger_evidence=)`, `q1_retrospective_diagnostic=` | Q1-only, cannot work in this harness |
| `QualifyingGridEntry.start_type` dropped by `validate_qualifying_grid` | real bug, fixed in `3810c1ad` |
| `predict_race(grid_scenarios=)` | **stopped here** |

The last one is not plumbing. `race_view_replay.py` passes joint scenarios into
`predict_race` and validates a matching scenario count in the result, so the
race simulation has to sample its starting grid from those scenarios. Rebuilding
that means inventing how scenarios map to draws, how the marginal path stays
seed-comparable, and how the grid anchor is chosen — three decisions with no
surviving source. A wrong reconstruction produces numbers that look valid.

## Open — worth testing when there is time

Ranked by expected value, not by effort.

1. **Raw-laps replay** (`docs/RAW_LAPS_REPLAY_HANDOFF.md`) — the only thing that
   makes Q1 and R0 testable. Everything else in this list is smaller.
2. **Team-strength residual** — the largest known error in the current champion.
   SAI −5.67 and LAW +6.44 are team-level, and `overall_performance` already
   ranks Williams and Audi correctly while the blended strength does not.
3. **Gauge-fix the driver seconds at fit time** — centering currently happens at
   prediction time. `_update_pair_constraint` only applies difference
   constraints, so the per-team level is unidentified and the contamination will
   regrow at the next seeding. Proper fix: centre inside
   `attach_driver_rating_mus` before `team_target_s` is computed, then refit
   `data/processed/team_strength_seconds_mapping/latest.json`.
4. **Combination runs** — every variant so far was tested alone against
   champion. Nothing has tested two changes together, so an interaction that
   only appears when both are active has never been visible.

## 2026-07-30: learning-path fixes, measured by decomposition

Baseline for every number below: `3810c1ad`, rebuilt from the 2026-04-25
preseason driver artifact (`710fb551`) with seconds re-seeded, then all 11
completed rounds replayed offline. **Qualifying MAE 2.6195, mean per-driver
|bias| 1.5522**, scored as the champion protocol above over the 9-event catalog
x 3 seeds (594 driver-events).

Rebuilding matters: the same old code measured against the *stored* 6-round
artifact scores 2.8788. Production had been stuck at 6 rounds because practice
capture reset the season history every Friday. Comparing a fixed model against
that stale artifact credits the fixes with 0.164 MAE they did not earn.

| variant | MAE | mean \|bias\| | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| DB-first read + recency-weighted season mean + margin-scored fallback | **2.5993** | **1.4747** | `adopted` |
| the above, plus skipping unpaired drivers in the Bayesian update | 2.8148 | 1.6094 | `worse` |
| the above, with learn-time recency neutralised | 2.8013 | 1.6128 | `worse` |

The three-way split is the point. Measured as one change the package looks like
a 0.064 MAE improvement over the stale artifact and is really a 0.195
regression against a fair baseline. Neutralising the recency weighting moved it
0.014, so that was not the cause. Reverting only the Bayesian change recovered
0.215 and beat baseline.

**Skipping unpaired drivers is `worse`, and the reasoning behind it still
holds.** `update_teammate_relative` gives a driver whose teammate retired the
raw absolute 1..grid_size rating, mixing that scale into a model centred on the
field mean — 32 such observations across the replay set, including one driver
observed at the maximum 22.00 from the single race their teammate retired from.
Dropping those observations costs more than the contamination does. The next
attempt should rescale them, not discard them. Do not re-test discarding.

Related negative result the same day: disabling the `rating_mu` -> skill/pace
blend (`bayesian_quali_skill_blend_cap: 0.0`) scored 3.0505 against a 2.8788
baseline. `rating_mu` correlates only -0.068 with actual qualifying position,
but the raw characteristics it falls back to are worse still.

### Bayesian update confidence rebalance - `worse`

Same baseline and protocol as the entry above. `rating_mu` is a single
position-scale rating updated by both race and qualifying, and it feeds the
*qualifying* skill and pace blend. Race observations carry
`teammate_relative_confidence: 0.35` while qualifying carries
`qualifying_update_confidence: 0.15`, so the qualifying skill term is weighted
more by race results than by qualifying ones.

The distortion that predicts is visible in the 2026 data: backmarkers finish far
better than they qualify (ALO -4.09, STR -4.00, PER -4.16 positions) and
front-runners finish worse (ANT +2.78, RUS +0.94), matching the sign of the
residual bias on both groups.

| variant | MAE | mean abs bias | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| champion, quali 0.15 / race 0.35 | **2.5993** | **1.4747** | `adopted` |
| quali 0.35 / race 0.35 | 2.6970 | 1.5354 | `worse` |
| quali 0.35 / race 0.15 | 2.7811 | 1.6667 | `worse` |

Both directions lost, so the shipped 0.15/0.35 split is better than either. The
mechanism above is real but these weights are not the lever that fixes it.
HUL's residual bias sat between +4.5 and +5.3 in every arm including champion,
so nothing here moved the driver the hypothesis was aimed at. Do not re-test
either direction without a new mechanism.

### Margin-scored telemetry race pace - `worse`

Same baseline and protocol. `extract_team_performance_from_telemetry` computes a
per-team median race lap time and then discards it for
`1.0 - rank/(team_count-1)`, so team strength cannot express how large a gap
was. This variant kept the margin: delta against the field median as a fraction
of lap time (track-length invariant), mapped onto 0-1 by a configurable spread.

| variant | MAE | mean abs bias | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| champion, rank-collapsed | **2.5993** | **1.4747** | `adopted` |
| margin, spread 0.06 | 2.6700 | 1.7138 | `worse` |
| margin, spread 0.10 | 2.7744 | 1.8586 | `worse` |

It did what it was designed to do: Aston's season went from a flat
`[0.1, 0.0, 0.0, ...]` to `[0.028, 0.042, 0.04, 0.147, 0.0, 0.43, ..., 0.447]`,
so an upgrade that closes a deficit without changing rank is finally visible.
Qualifying accuracy still got worse, and monotonically - the wider the spread,
the worse the result, meaning the closer the scoring stays to rank the better.

The reason is the input, not the idea. A race median lap time carries strategy,
traffic, fuel load and safety cars: across three 2026 races the team spread was
4.6-4.8s, more than twice the 1.97 s/unit that
`team_strength_seconds_mapping` was fitted for. Rank is robust to that noise and
margin propagates it. Do not retry margin scoring on race medians.

The idea is not dead, but it needs a pace measure built for it. The matched-lap
same-session construct in `src/extractors/matched_laps.py` is what the seconds
mapping was actually fitted on; converting *that* through the calibrated slope
is the version worth testing. Converting race medians through it would be a
scale error, mixing two different definitions of "seconds".

### The lambda sweep that closes P0 — `noise`, monotone, no interior optimum

The gate-2 loss was traced to SE under-dispersion at n=2, so the follow-up asks whether the recovered
observations have any value once their uncertainty is honest. Sweep an inflation factor applied to
`matched_gap_se_s` for rows with fewer than 3 matched pairs, at gate 2. The null is exact: as lambda
grows the recovered rows carry no weight and the arm reduces to the gate-3 baseline.

Same preseason-rebuilt baseline, 13 rounds of 2026, paired over 46 common checkpoints:

| arm | qualifying MAE | mean delta | 95% bootstrap CI | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| gate 3 (baseline) | 2.3363 | — | — | — |
| gate 2, lambda 1 | 2.3931 | +0.0633 | [+0.0062, +0.1204] | `worse` |
| gate 2, lambda 2 | 2.3507 | +0.0221 | [-0.0285, +0.0749] | `noise` |
| gate 2, lambda 4 | 2.3333 | +0.0023 | [-0.0448, +0.0471] | `noise` |

**Monotone toward the baseline with no bowl.** The response has no interior optimum: the best the
recovered observations achieve is to be down-weighted until they change nothing, which is what the
gate already does by discarding them. Recovering them is worth nothing in accuracy terms.

Per-checkpoint, no cell reaches significance at these fold counts:

| checkpoint | lambda 2 mean | CI | lambda 4 mean | CI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PRE (n=13) | **-0.0360** | [-0.1409, +0.0559] | **-0.0280** | [-0.1119, +0.0490] |
| FP1 (n=13) | +0.0343 | [-0.0503, +0.1252] | +0.0053 | [-0.0949, +0.1036] |
| FP2 (n=8) | +0.0514 | [-0.0341, +0.1364] | +0.0168 | [-0.0682, +0.1304] |
| FP3 (n=7) | +0.0779 | [-0.0519, +0.2338] | +0.0779 | [-0.0130, +0.1558] |
| SQ (n=5) | +0.0165 | [-0.1489, +0.1818] | -0.0563 | [-0.1853, +0.0727] |

**The one consistently-signed sub-result is PRE**, negative (better) at both lambdas. PRE is the only
checkpoint with no practice data, so it is where driver ratings carry the most weight, and it is the
checkpoint the original P0 claim was about. The confidence interval includes zero at n=13, so this is
directional, not proven, and it is swamped by the other checkpoints in the aggregate.

**Verdict: P0 is closed as `noise`.** The coverage defect is real and precisely located — Aston Martin
discards 15 of 18 qualifying observations, McLaren none — and it does not cost measurable accuracy.
The gate stands. Anyone reopening this should score PRE alone across more rounds rather than repeat
the aggregate.

**The sweep hook was temporary** (`TL_MIN_QUALI_PAIRS`, `TL_LOWN_SE_INFLATE`, `_swept_se` in
`src/extractors/matched_laps.py`) and is reverted; with both variables unset the code is
byte-identical to shipped, which was verified before the sweep started.

### Still open

- `extract_team_performance_from_telemetry` computes real median lap times per
  team, then discards them for `1.0 - rank/(team_count-1)`. It is the primary
  path for most races, so team strength still cannot express margin; the
  2026-07-30 fallback fix only reached races where telemetry was missing.
  `team_strength_seconds_mapping/latest.json` already has the calibrated slope
  to convert lap-time deltas directly.
- HUL degrades **as the season is learned**, on unmodified code: +1.52 at 6
  rounds, +5.26 at 11. RUS moves +0.15 -> +2.19 the same way. Whatever causes
  that is in the learning path and predates all of the above.
  **Superseded 2026-07-31** — see the section below. The "learning path" framing
  is wrong, and treating HUL and RUS as one phenomenon is wrong.

## 2026-07-31: the HUL/RUS drift is not a driver-rating problem

**No prediction run was made for this entry.** Everything below is derived from
the shipped artifacts (`car_characteristics` v23 at 11 rounds,
`driver_characteristics` v26, `team_strength_seconds_mapping/latest.json`), the
9-event `event_catalog.json`, and code at `6771a8a5`. It carries no MAE because
it scores no variant. It is here to stop the next session spending runs on a
path that arithmetic already closes.

### The driver rating cannot produce an error this large

Centred `quali_rating_mu_s` for HUL is **-0.1225 s**
(`center_rating_mu_by_team`, `qualifying_preparation.py:807`). The qualifying
simulation projects it as `0.5 + seconds_delta / 1.9708`, clipped to [0, 1]
(`qualifying_simulation.py:359`). So HUL's entire driver term is **0.062 score
units**, and a 22-car grid spans 1.0 unit at roughly 0.045 units per position.

**Driver-term authority: about 1.4 grid positions. HUL's bias is +5.26.**

This is the explanation for the four failed hypotheses above. None of them was
obviously wrong in mechanism; all of them were pulling a lever with ~1.4
positions of authority against a ~5.3 position error. Do not test another
driver-rating variant against this bias without first showing the path has
enough authority to matter.

### Both teammates carry the same-signed bias, so it is a team offset

Recorded elsewhere in this file but never connected: HUL +5.26 / BOR +4.44
(champion-history note), RUS +2.19 / ANT +2.78 (confidence-rebalance section).
Same sign, comparable magnitude, same team, both pairs. That is the signature of
a team-strength offset, not a driver-rating error. **"The HUL/RUS bias" is a
misnomer for an Audi and Mercedes team-strength bias.**

### HUL and RUS do not share a mechanism

Model teammate ordering (centred `quali_rating_mu_s`, positive = faster) against
actual head-to-head over the 9 catalog events:

| team | model rates faster | actual H2H | agrees |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audi | BOR (+0.1225) | **HUL 5-4** | no |
| Red Bull | HAD (+0.0079) | **VER 6-3** | no |
| RB | LIN (+0.0955) | **LAW 6-3** | no |
| Cadillac | BOT (+0.1440) | **PER 6-3** | no |
| Mercedes | ANT (+0.1003) | ANT 5-4 | yes |
| McLaren | NOR (+0.0878) | NOR 5-4 | yes |
| Ferrari | LEC (+0.0099) | LEC 5-4 | yes |
| Aston Martin | ALO (+0.3537) | ALO 7-2 | yes |
| Alpine | GAS (+0.0221) | GAS 6-3 | yes |
| Haas | BEA (+0.1161) | BEA 7-2 | yes |
| Williams | SAI (+0.0442) | SAI 7-2 | yes |

Four of eleven pairs are ordered backwards. HUL is one of them. **RUS is not** —
Antonelli genuinely out-qualified him 5-4, so that rating direction is correct
and RUS's residual has to come from Mercedes team strength alone. Lumping the
two drivers into one phenomenon is what framed the whole search wrongly.

Sign convention verified rather than assumed: `sign_convention:
positive_seconds_means_faster_than_field` in the mapping artifact, consistent
with the `0.5 + delta/scale` projection where higher score is a better grid slot.

### Observation count does not compress the teammate gap - hypothesis killed

Worth stating because it looks plausible and costs a run to test. Centred
teammate gap against `quali_rating_observations` across all 11 teams shows no
relationship: Audi at 11 observations has the **largest** gap among
well-observed teams (0.245 s), Red Bull at 12 observations has the **smallest**
(0.016 s). Aston Martin's 0.708 s gap sits on 3 observations, so the two
extremes are the low-observation teams in both directions.

Do not test "more learning shrinks teammate gaps".

### Separate bug found while measuring: qualifying uses the race slope

`config/default.yaml:219` sets
`team_strength_seconds_score_scale: 1.9707717329051126`. That is the **race**
slope from `team_strength_seconds_mapping/latest.json`. It is applied in the
**qualifying** projection at `qualifying_simulation.py:359`, where the fitted
qualifying slope is **1.7741686893278807**.

Every qualifying deviation from 0.5 is therefore compressed by about 11%. This
is unrelated to the HUL residual and is a one-line fix, but it rescales the
whole qualifying grid, so measure it on its own before or after anything else —
never bundled.

### Team-vs-driver decomposition, measured - confirms the reframe

`identify_systematic_errors` (`src/analysis/model_evaluation.py:427`) already
computes `team_bias` alongside `driver_bias`. Every measurement before this one
read `driver_bias` only. Running both over cached champion predictions
decomposes each driver's residual into a team-shared component and a
within-pair component.

**Baseline caveat, and it is material.** The only cached champion predictions
are `source_digest` `3f07ca70`, written **2026-07-19 to 2026-07-22**, so they
predate the 2026-07-28 centering fix `93bfbeb0`. The prediction cache key does
not cover code version — the trap documented under "Measurement protocol" — so
these levels are *not* current-champion numbers. HUL reads +6.86 here against
+5.26 on rebuilt current code.

**The levels are stale; the decomposition is the claim.** The centering fix
removes the team-mean component of the driver rating, so on current code the
within-pair component can only be smaller than what is shown here. That
strengthens the conclusion rather than threatening it.

Protocol: champion variant, `qualifying` kind, `PRE` checkpoint, 7 events x 3
seeds, 462 driver-observations, actuals from `actual_qualifying_grid` in
`event_catalog.json`. Positive means too pessimistic.

| team | team bias | driver 1 | driver 2 | within-pair spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Audi** | **+6.71** | HUL **+6.86** | BOR **+6.57** | **0.29** |
| Williams | -7.10 | SAI -7.86 | ALB -6.33 | 1.53 |
| RB | +3.33 | LAW +2.48 | LIN +4.19 | 1.71 |
| McLaren | +1.74 | NOR +0.90 | PIA +2.57 | 1.67 |
| Mercedes | +1.14 | RUS +0.14 | ANT +2.14 | 2.00 |
| Alpine | +1.12 | GAS +1.48 | COL +0.76 | 0.72 |
| Cadillac F1 | +0.05 | PER +1.29 | BOT -1.19 | 2.48 |
| Haas F1 Team | -0.81 | OCO +0.62 | BEA -2.24 | 2.86 |
| Ferrari | -0.90 | LEC -0.76 | HAM -1.05 | 0.29 |
| Red Bull Racing | -2.43 | VER -5.52 | HAD +0.67 | **6.19** |
| Aston Martin | -2.86 | ALO -5.52 | STR -0.19 | **5.33** |

#### Correction, same day: the two extreme rows are the already-fixed bug

The first reading of this table treated Audi +6.71 and Williams -7.10 as the
largest *unexplained* errors in this file. That was wrong, and the table's own
baseline is why.

These cached predictions predate `93bfbeb0`, so they ran with **uncentered**
`quali_rating_mu_s` — the double-counted car pace that `93bfbeb0` fixed. The raw
team-mean driver rating still shows the size of it (values from the current
11-round artifact, so indicative of the state in force rather than exact):

| team | team-mean raw rating | implied position effect |
|---|---|---|
| Williams | +0.412 s | **+4.60** |
| Audi | -0.387 s | **-4.32** |

That is an 8.9 position spread between the two teams from the driver-rating term
alone. The observed gap in predicted mean position is **9.67** (Audi 18.86 vs
Williams 9.19) on team strengths that are nearly identical (0.366 vs 0.354) and
correctly ranked — Williams' strength rank 9 matches its actual rank 9.

So the team strength for both teams is approximately right, and the prediction
error is the uncentered driver term. This is the same defect the champion-history
entry already records collapsing: HUL +6.11 -> +1.67, ALB -5.78 -> +0.11.
**Audi and Williams are not open problems. They are the pre-`93bfbeb0` state.**

#### What this does to the HUL conclusion

The "HUL is closed as a driver problem" reading above is **withdrawn**, but the
stated reason for withdrawing it was also wrong, and the third pass settled both.
Recorded in full because two of the three readings here were mistakes.

**The within-pair column measures separation *error*, not driver-term magnitude.**
Bias is predicted minus actual per driver, so the spread between teammates is
`(predicted gap) - (actual gap)`. Audi's 0.29 does not mean the driver term is
inert; it means the pre-fix model got HUL-vs-BOR *separation* about right while
both drivers carried the same large shared offset. The column is readable — just
not as "how many positions of driver signal exist".

**The clip is not what compresses Audi.** Neither Audi driver is near a bound.
That hypothesis is dead.

### The clip is binding, at the front of the grid

Testing it turned up a different result. Deterministic score is
`clip(0.5 + 1.7742*(strength-0.5)/1.9708 + driver_mu/1.9708, 0, 1)`. Evaluated
over all 22 drivers on 6-round strengths:

| state | drivers hitting a bound |
|---|---|
| raw / pre-`93bfbeb0` | **ANT 1.136, LEC 1.060, HAM 1.050, RUS 1.035** (all clipped to 1.0), STR -0.049 (clipped to 0) |
| centred / post-`93bfbeb0` | STR only |

Before the fix, **four front-runners collapsed onto the identical score 1.0**, so
their relative order was simulation noise rather than signal. That is a second,
previously unrecorded consequence of the uncentered ratings, and `93bfbeb0`
incidentally fixed it. Worth knowing for any pre-fix number involving Mercedes or
Ferrari: their internal ordering was not being modelled at all.

The team term alone cannot reach a bound — it spans only ±0.42 against a ±0.5
threshold — so every clip event needs the driver term to push it over. Post-
centering, only Aston Martin still clips.

### Current-state driver ordering, and the one that is wrong

Ranking all 22 drivers by centred deterministic score — current 11-round
strengths and current ratings, so this *is* today's state — against actual
head-to-head over the 9 catalog events:

| pair | model order (centred rank) | actual H2H | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Audi** | **BOR 13, HUL 18** | **HUL 5-4** | **inverted by 5 positions** |
| Red Bull | HAD 7, VER 8 | VER 6-3 | inverted by 1 |
| Mercedes | ANT 1, RUS 2 | ANT 5-4 | correct |
| Williams | SAI 14, ALB 16 | SAI 7-2 | correct |
| Aston Martin | ALO 19, STR 22 | ALO 7-2 | correct |

**HUL sits five places behind the teammate he actually outqualifies.** That is
the largest live driver-level error on the grid and it is a sign error, not a
magnitude error. It is unaffected by everything withdrawn above: it uses centred
ratings, current artifacts, and actual results — no cached prediction, no
pre-fix state.

So driver-level work does belong on HUL/BOR after all, but for the inversion, not
for the "degrades as the season is learned" framing that opened this
investigation. Caveat: deterministic score ordering is not simulated mean
position — Q1/Q2/Q3 structure and noise both intervene — so treat the rank gaps
as indicative and the sign as the finding.

### Mechanism of the inversion: rookie prior sigma sets the update gain

**There is no sign bug.** The path was checked end to end and is consistent:
`matched_gap_s = comparison_lap_time_s - reference_lap_time_s`, positive means
reference faster (`matched_laps.py:164`); `innovation = observed_gap -
(reference_mu - comparison_mu)` raises `reference_mu` on positive innovation
(`driver_seconds_state.py:267`); higher mu is faster. Do not re-hunt this.

**The prior had HUL and VER the right way round; 2026 flipped them.** Seed values
from `teammate_network_prior/latest.json` (2022-2025) against the current
11-round state:

| pair | prior mu (a / b) | prior sigma | var ratio b:a | now | flipped |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Red Bull VER/HAD | +0.447 / -0.145 | 0.152 / 0.530 | **12.2** | +0.299 / +0.315 | **yes** |
| Audi HUL/BOR | -0.461 / -0.554 | 0.231 / 0.530 | **5.3** | -0.509 / -0.264 | **yes** |
| Mercedes RUS/ANT | +0.453 / +0.232 | 0.277 / 0.530 | **3.7** | +0.226 / +0.426 | **yes** |
| Aston ALO/STR | +0.143 / -0.111 | 0.152 / 0.155 | 1.1 | +0.364 / -0.343 | no |
| Ferrari LEC/HAM | +0.498 / +0.395 | 0.273 / 0.275 | 1.0 | +0.456 / +0.437 | no |
| Williams SAI/ALB | +0.421 / +0.405 | 0.272 / 0.260 | 0.9 | +0.456 / +0.368 | no |

**Every pair with a variance ratio above ~3 reordered. Every pair near 1.0 held.**
The pair update splits each innovation in proportion to variance
(`updated_reference_mu = reference_mu + (reference_var/denominator)*innovation`),
so the wider-prior driver absorbs the update. Audi: BOR moved +0.289 while HUL
moved -0.048. Red Bull: HAD moved +0.460 while VER moved -0.148.

`BOR`, `HAD` and `ANT` all carry sigma **0.5304206197376727** — bit-identical, so
it is a shared default for low-observation drivers, not a fitted value. Against
HUL's 0.231 (n=37) and VER's 0.152 (n=74) that is a 5x to 12x gain advantage on
every observation.

Cadillac PER/BOT has ratio 12.2 and did *not* flip, because the prior already had
BOT ahead and he simply moved further ahead. Consistent with the mechanism rather
than a counterexample.

**This is correct Bayesian behaviour given those priors, and it is not always
wrong** — the Mercedes flip agrees with actual head-to-head (ANT 5-4). The
question the mechanism raises is narrower: whether 0.5304 is the right default,
and whether qualifying evidence is strong enough to justify that gain.
`min_matched_pairs_quali` is **3**, most qualifying sessions produce exactly 3
matched pairs, and in 2025 eleven of twenty-one BOR/HUL qualifying sessions
produced no usable aggregate at all (`insufficient_matched_pairs`). Ratings are
being reordered on three-lap medians.

Two levers, neither tested: raise the low-observation prior sigma default, or
raise `min_matched_pairs_quali`. See the scoring note at the end of this section
for what testing them actually costs — it is not just a config edit.

### Measured on current code, and the mechanism holds

The blocked walk-forward was routed around. A champion-only scorer calling
production `Baseline2026Predictor.predict_qualifying(..., practice_signal_mode=
"stored_profiles")` plus the tracked `identify_systematic_errors` reproduces the
decomposition without touching the shelved tree. 7 dry events x 3 seeds x 20
simulations, 462 driver-observations, about 2 minutes.

**This is not a walk-forward.** Every event is predicted against the current
artifact state, which already contains that event's results. Absolute error is
optimistic and **not comparable to the walk-forward numbers above**. Both arms of
an A/B carry the same leakage, so deltas remain usable. Recorded level:
MAE 2.6494, mean per-driver |bias| 1.7186.

| team | team bias | driver 1 | driver 2 | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Audi | +2.26 | HUL **+4.62** | BOR -0.10 | 4.71 |
| RB | +1.45 | LAW **+3.38** | LIN -0.48 | 3.86 |
| Mercedes | +1.29 | RUS **+3.14** | ANT -0.57 | 3.71 |
| Cadillac F1 | +0.98 | PER +1.67 | BOT +0.29 | 1.38 |
| Ferrari | +0.55 | LEC +0.29 | HAM +0.81 | 0.52 |
| Haas F1 Team | +0.31 | OCO **+2.38** | BEA -1.76 | 4.14 |
| Alpine | -0.43 | GAS +0.24 | COL -1.10 | 1.33 |
| Williams | -1.38 | SAI -2.19 | ALB -0.57 | 1.62 |
| Red Bull Racing | -1.52 | VER -3.95 | HAD +0.90 | 4.86 |
| McLaren | -1.69 | NOR -4.05 | PIA +0.67 | 4.71 |
| Aston Martin | -1.81 | ALO -4.14 | STR +0.52 | 4.67 |

**The picture inverted relative to the pre-`93bfbeb0` table, exactly as
predicted.** Largest team offset fell from 7.10 to 2.26 — the centering fix
removed the shared component — and the within-pair spreads grew from a 0.29-2.00
band to 3.7-4.9. Pre-fix, teammates shared one large offset and the driver error
was hidden inside it. Post-fix the offset is gone and the driver error is what is
left. This also retroactively confirms the correction above: the pre-fix
within-pair column really was measuring separation error against a shared offset.

**Where a wide-prior rookie exists, the veteran carries the positive bias and the
rookie sits near zero**: Audi (HUL +4.62 / BOR -0.10), RB (LAW +3.38 / LIN
-0.48), Mercedes (RUS +3.14 / ANT -0.57), Haas (OCO +2.38 / BEA -1.76). Four of
the six such pairs. The rookie's rating has been pulled to fit and the veteran
absorbs the residual.

**Refinement: the mechanism is overshoot, not inversion.** Mercedes is the case
that shows it. The model's ANT-ahead ordering *agrees* with head-to-head, yet the
rating gap is 0.20 s (~2.3 positions) on a 5-4 split, and RUS still carries
+3.14. Rookie gain moves the rating too far whether or not it crosses over.
Crossing over (Audi, RB) is the visible symptom; the magnitude error is the
disease, and it is present in pairs that look correctly ordered.

**Red Bull is not this mechanism.** VER -3.95 with HAD +0.90 is the opposite
sign, and the VER/HAD rating gap is 0.016 s — about one position, far too small
to produce it. Red Bull's error is team strength, not driver rating. Same for
McLaren and Aston Martin, both of which have near-equal teammate sigmas and so no
gain asymmetry at all.

### The prior sigma is a clamp, not an estimate - both tuning levers rejected

Before scoring either lever, the quantity they tune was checked. It is not a
per-driver uncertainty for most of the grid.

`_driver_sigma` (`scripts/build_teammate_network_prior.py:841`) has three
branches:

```python
fallback_sigma = max(1.75 * population_sd_s, sigma_floor_s)
if not anchored:                                    return fallback_sigma
if n_observations < config.min_driver_observations: return fallback_sigma
trusted_sigma = max(bootstrap_sigmas[driver], 0.5 * population_sd_s, sigma_floor_s)
```

With `main_component_population_sd_s = 0.3030975`, both saturation values in the
artifact fall out exactly:

- `1.75 * 0.3030975 = 0.530421` — the fallback, **14 of 31 drivers**
- `0.5  * 0.3030975 = 0.151549` — the floor, **9 of 31 drivers**

**23 of 31 drivers carry a clamp. Only 8 have a sigma derived from their own
bootstrap.** The cliff is `min_driver_observations = 24`:

| driver | n_obs | sigma | source |
|---|---|---|---|
| DOO | 3 | 0.5304 | fallback |
| BOR | 10 | 0.5304 | fallback |
| ANT | 19 | 0.5304 | fallback |
| LAW | 23 | 0.5304 | fallback |
| RIC | 31 | 0.1515 | floor |
| HUL | 37 | 0.2309 | bootstrap |

DOO at 3 observations and LAW at 23 are assigned identical uncertainty. LAW and
RIC differ by eight observations and land 3.5x apart. **The quantity that sets
Bayesian update gain is a step function at an arbitrary threshold, with no
gradient across three quarters of the grid.**

**Both tuning levers are therefore rejected without being scored.** Raising the
`0.5304` default would mean overriding a fitted population quantity with a
hand-picked one to compensate for a threshold artefact, and it would move all 14
fallback drivers together regardless of whether they have 3 observations or 23.
Raising `min_matched_pairs_quali` starves an evidence stream that already fails
to produce an aggregate in half of all qualifying sessions. Neither survives at
20 rounds; both are counter-tuning.

**The structural fix, not attempted:** make the prior sigma continuous in
evidence — one shrinkage scaling with observation count and graph connectivity —
replacing the fallback / bootstrap / floor branches. Then BOR at 10 and LAW at 23
differ because their evidence differs, and the rookie-gain overshoot dissolves
rather than being counter-tuned.

Two caveats before anyone builds it. First, **nothing here has been shown to
convert into MAE** — the base rate on this bias is four mechanisms, four losses,
and a smaller |bias| is not automatically a smaller MAE. Run the cheap
prediction-side proxy (scale the centred teammate gap and re-score) to establish
the sign before spending a rebuild. Second, `population_sd_s` is itself a
main-component fit output, so a continuous scheme needs its own validation rather
than a drop-in swap.

### What scoring the two levers would have cost

Neither lever is testable by editing config and re-predicting. Both change how
state is *learned*:

- `min_matched_pairs_quali` gates aggregate-row production in the extractor.
- the 0.5304 prior sigma lives in `teammate_network_prior/latest.json`, built by
  `scripts/build_teammate_network_prior.py`.

So each arm needs: rebuild the prior (sigma arm only) -> re-seed driver seconds
-> replay all completed rounds -> then score. That is the rebuild procedure with
its two documented silent traps (the driver-baseline default that double-counts,
and `USE_DB_STORAGE` replaying onto stored state). Budget an hour per arm, not a
config edit. The scorer is the cheap half and it already exists.

### Still open after this

- Re-measure the decomposition on current code. The table above is structurally
  sound but its levels predate `93bfbeb0`, and no cached champion prediction
  exists after that commit.
  **Attempted 2026-07-31 via `run_challenger_research_walk_forward.py` and
  `refused`** — `TypeError: BaselineQualifyingMixin.predict_qualifying() got an
  unexpected keyword argument 'include_grid_scenarios'`. That is the first row
  of the "Blocked" table above: the challenger harness has been shelved since
  2026-07-29 and cannot run against current production code. **The walk-forward
  runner is not a route to a champion re-measurement.** Note the runner exits 0
  after printing the traceback, so a re-run that "completes" has still produced
  nothing.
  The remaining route is champion-only and avoids the shelved tree entirely:
  `predict_qualifying(year, race_name, practice_signal_mode="stored_profiles")`
  is production API, and `historical_replay.py`, `checkpoint_reconstruction.py`
  and `model_evaluation.py` are all tracked. It needs a small purpose-built
  driver loop over the 9 catalog events, which is a reconstruction — smaller
  and lower-risk than the race-scenario reconstruction that stopped the
  challenger work, but still capable of producing plausible wrong numbers if
  the checkpoint state is assembled incorrectly. Not attempted.
- ~~The Audi and Williams team offsets are the two largest single errors in this
  file and have no mechanism.~~ **Withdrawn the same day** — see the correction
  above. Both are the pre-`93bfbeb0` uncentered driver rating, already fixed.
  Neither is a team-strength question: both teams' strength values are about
  right and correctly ranked.
- ~~Why does a back-of-grid pair's predicted positions compress?~~ **Settled the
  same day** — nothing compresses. The within-pair column is a separation
  *error*, and no Audi driver is near the clip. See the correction above.
- **HUL/BOR is inverted by five positions in the current state** and is the
  largest live driver-level error found. Sign error, not magnitude. This is the
  one open item from this investigation that rests on nothing withdrawn.
  Mechanism identified and then confirmed on current code (HUL +4.62 against BOR
  -0.10): the shared low-observation prior sigma `0.5304` gives a rookie teammate
  5-12x the update gain of an established one, so thin qualifying evidence pulls
  the rookie's rating too far. **Overshoot, not inversion** — Mercedes is ordered
  correctly and still carries RUS +3.14, so pairs that look right are affected
  too. ~~Two levers: the prior sigma default and `min_matched_pairs_quali`.~~
  **Both rejected without scoring** — see "The prior sigma is a clamp, not an
  estimate". The open item is the structural fix (continuous sigma), gated on the
  cheap proxy showing the direction pays at all.
- **Red Bull, McLaren and Aston Martin are a separate problem.** Large
  within-pair spreads (4.9, 4.7, 4.7) with the wrong sign for rookie gain, and
  near-equal teammate sigmas, so no gain asymmetry exists to explain them. VER
  -3.95, NOR -4.05, ALO -4.14 are all the stronger driver predicted too well.
  Unexplained; likely team strength.
- **Four front-runners clipped to an identical 1.0 before `93bfbeb0`.** Any
  pre-fix result that depends on the internal ordering of Mercedes or Ferrari is
  reading noise. Applies retroactively to entries above measured on that state.
- The four inverted teammate pairs (Audi, Red Bull, RB, Cadillac) are measured
  against actual head-to-head, not against a model state, so they are unaffected
  by the baseline problem above.

## 2026-08-03: the low-observation prior sigma, finally scored — `noise`

Supersedes "both tuning levers rejected without being scored" above for the
sigma lever only. The rejection reasoning there still reads correctly; what it
could not know is how little the lever moves. `min_matched_pairs_quali` remains
unscored.

**What the variant changes.** One number: the low-observation prior sigma
multiplier in `_driver_sigma`, `1.75 * population_sd_s`. Exposed as
`--low-observation-sigma-multiplier` in `2aafbfc2` so an arm needs no source
edit. Nothing else differs between arms.

**Baseline.** Champion `b1381e06`. Arms ran on `71fa3615`, which adds only the
flag and the scorer; rebuilding the prior at the 1.75 default reproduces the
shipped artifact except at the 16th significant digit, so the flag is
behaviour-preserving.

**Protocol — differs from the one above.** Scored with
`scripts/champion_quali_bias.py`, 9 catalog events x 3 seeds x 20 simulations,
`--all-events` so wet rounds are included. **Leakage-inclusive**: every event is
predicted against a state containing its own result, so these MAEs are not
comparable to the walk-forward numbers elsewhere in this file. Valid only as
a delta between arms carrying identical leakage.

Each arm ran the full path — rebuild prior, rebuild rookie fallback, restore the
`710fb551` preseason driver artifact, re-seed, replay all 11 rounds, score. Both
documented traps were avoided (explicit `--driver-baseline-file` via the
preseason restore, `USE_DB_STORAGE` unset). Cost was **16s per race, about 6
minutes per arm**, not the hour budgeted above.

**Harness validation.** The 1.75 arm — full preseason reseed plus 11-round
replay — reproduces the shipped production artifact's score exactly: MAE 2.6734,
HUL +4.89, BOR -1.22, every team row identical. The rebuild path is faithful.

| arm | multiplier | rookie:established update gain | MAE | mean per-driver \|bias\| | HUL | Audi spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 1.75 | 5.28x | 2.6734 | 1.4747 | +4.89 | 6.11 |
| arm | 1.00 | 1.72x | 2.6734 | 1.4579 | +4.85 | 6.00 |
| bound | 0.50 | 0.43x | 2.6599 | 1.4141 | +4.74 | 5.81 |

**Verdict: `noise`.** Cutting rookie update gain from 5.28x to 1.72x moves HUL
by 0.04 grid positions and leaves MAE bit-identical. The 0.5 bound is included
only to bracket the channel — it is not a defensible setting, because it gives a
10-observation rookie *less* update gain than a 37-observation veteran — and even
there HUL improves 0.15 against a +4.89 error, roughly 3% of the authority
required. The scorer is deterministic (verified: byte-identical artifacts and
exact MAE reproduction across runs), so these are real differences, not sampling
variation. They are simply immaterial.

Direction of every pair is consistent and correct — spreads shrink, |bias|
falls — so the mechanism described above is real. It is not load-bearing.

**Which pairs respond.** RB moves most (spread 4.00 -> 3.19 at the bound, -0.81),
consistent with LAW sitting at 23 observations, one short of the cliff. Mercedes
moves the wrong way (RUS +2.59 -> +2.67). Aston Martin does not move at all.

**What this closes.** The open item above gates the structural fix (continuous
sigma) on "the cheap proxy showing the direction pays at all". The proxy has now
been run at two settings including an extreme bound. **The direction pays, and
pays about 3% of what is needed.** Building a continuous-shrinkage scheme to
capture a 0.15-position effect on the largest live error is not worth it on this
evidence. The clamp remains poor engineering — a step function where a gradient
belongs — but it is not the cause of the HUL/RUS drift, and fixing it will not
fix that.

This is the fifth mechanism tested against this bias and the fifth to lose. The
authority-ceiling argument continues to hold: the driver-rating path cannot
produce a 5-position error, so the cause is not on that path.

## 2026-08-03: centring the prior mu at fit time — `worse`, built and reverted

Built, measured, adopted, then reverted the same day, so it reaches `master` only
as this entry. Recorded in full because the failure mode is more useful than the
change: **it improved the headline metric and was still wrong.**

**The thesis.** `93bfbeb0` centred `quali_rating_mu_s` on the prediction path and
named the rest of the job in its own message — centre inside
`attach_driver_rating_mus` before `team_target_s` is formed, then refit the
mapping. Fit time used the uncentered mu while prediction time used the centred
one, so the two disagreed. Making them agree steepened the fitted slopes by ~20%
(qualifying 1.77417 → 2.12643, race 1.97077 → 2.33329).

**It measured better.** Qualifying MAE 2.6599 → 2.5724 and mean per-driver
\|bias\| 1.5017 → 1.3771 at 60 simulations, delta stable from 20 sims, within-pair
spread shrinking or holding for all 11 teams. Full suite green, golden fixtures
unmoved. On the evidence in this paragraph alone it looks like a clean adopt,
and it was committed as one.

**Four checks killed it**, in ascending order of how much they should have been
run first:

1. **The gain is a scalar.** Take the *shipped* mapping, multiply both slopes by
   1.1985, change nothing else — no centring, original intercepts — and it
   reproduces MAE 2.5724 and \|bias\| 1.3771 exactly. The intercept move
   contributes nothing, which is obvious in hindsight: a uniform shift cannot
   reorder a grid, and MAE here is a position metric.
2. **The derived multiplier is not the best one.** Sweeping the slope:

   | slope x | 0.8 | 1.0 | 1.1985 | 1.4 | 1.7 | 2.1 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | MAE | 2.7845 | 2.6734 | 2.5993 | **2.5825** | 2.6162 | 2.7071 |
   | \|bias\| | 1.6566 | 1.4747 | 1.3906 | 1.3502 | **1.2492** | 1.3367 |

   There is a real interior optimum, near 1.4, and the "principled" value misses
   it. Note also that \|bias\| and MAE optimise at different points — more
   evidence that \|bias\| is not a proxy for MAE.
3. **The refit generalises worse on its own held-out folds.** Qualifying mean
   \|prediction_slope − 1\| 0.2936 → 0.3097, race 0.0927 → **0.1941**, rmse worse
   in both session kinds, 2025 qualifying r² 0.3039 → 0.1192. `prediction_slope`
   falling means the steeper fit over-predicts spread on holdout years.
4. **The premise was wrong.** Centring assumed the prior's `mu_s` carries a
   spurious team component, by analogy with `93bfbeb0`. Measured: the
   within-team component has sd **0.2733** against a total mu sd of **0.3014**,
   so ~82% of that quantity's variance is *between*-team — largely real driver
   quality that correlates with team, because quick drivers sit in quick cars.
   Centring it moves genuine driver signal into `team_target_s`, which is why the
   target's spread inflated and the slope steepened. The 2026 season state that
   `93bfbeb0` fixed had drifted to carry a team offset; the historical
   teammate-network prior has not, and the analogy does not transfer.

**Verdict: `worse`.** Adopting would have baked a tuning constant into a
calibrated artefact on the strength of a 9-event leakage-inclusive delta, while
its own cross-validation said it was worse. Reverted, artefacts back to the
2026-05-19 fit.

### Correction to the above, same day — one kill-criterion retracted

Criterion 3, "generalises worse on held-out folds", **is withdrawn.** Those folds
are 2022–2025. The 2026 regulations changed the competitive structure of the
field, so pre-2026 seasons are not a valid arbiter of a 2026 mapping and should
not have been weighted as one. Criteria 1, 2 and 4 stand — all three are measured
on 2026 — so the revert itself still holds: the centring derivation is not what
produced the gain, and the value it produced was not the best one.

### The real finding — the mapping is fitted on the wrong regulations

`training_years` is **2022–2025**, entirely pre-regulation-change, and the
mapping has never seen a 2026 lap. Extracting 2026 matched laps with
`scripts/build_matched_lap_observations.py --years 2026` (3,356 matched pairs,
242 aggregate rows, 11 rounds) and fitting the same construct on 2026 alone:

| session | 2022–25 slope | 2026 slope | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| qualifying | 1.77417 | **2.76281** | **1.557** |
| race | 1.97077 | **3.89727** | **1.978** |

The current field is roughly 56% more spread in qualifying and nearly twice as
spread in the race. That is the actual defect: not a 20% miscalibration to be
patched, a mapping calibrated to a field that no longer exists. It also explains
why the centring hack appeared to work — it moved the slope 1.1985x, the right
direction and about a third of the way.

Scored against champion `52dd79c6`, 9 events x 3 seeds, 60 simulations:

| mapping | source | MAE | mean \|bias\| |
|---|---|---|---|
| shipped | 2022–25 | 2.6599 | 1.5017 |
| slope x1.1985 | tuned | 2.5724 | 1.3771 |
| fitted on all 2026 | in-sample | 2.5724 | **1.2997** |
| fitted on rounds 10–11 only | **out-of-sample** | 2.6263 | 1.3131 |

The last row is the one that matters: Belgian and Hungarian are **not** in the
9-event scoring catalog, so a mapping fitted on those two rounds alone and scored
on rounds 1–9 is genuinely out of sample, and it still improves both metrics.
That is a measured recalibration, not a constant tuned against the score.

**Also worth noting: position-MAE saturates here.** Three different mappings all
land on exactly 2.5724 while mean \|bias\| keeps falling from 1.3771 to 1.2997.
MAE is discretised to integer positions and is a coarse instrument at this
margin; do not read a flat MAE as "no change".

**Status: `open`, deliberately not adopted in this session.** The evidence is
much stronger than the centring case, but the honest limits are: 11 rounds of
2026 exist, the out-of-sample fit rests on 30 qualifying rows, and the race
mapping nearly doubled while the scorer measures qualifying only. The right
implementation is a 2026-inclusive or recency-weighted refit run through the
normal pipeline with its own validation — not a hand-edited artefact. Given this
file already contains one change adopted too quickly today, that decision is left
explicit rather than taken in passing.

## 2026-08-04: refit the seconds mapping on 2026 — `adopted`

Closes the `open` item from 2026-08-03. That entry established the defect and
deliberately stopped short of adopting; this is the pipeline version, with the
training-year choice argued from data rather than asserted.

**The defect.** `team_strength_seconds_mapping` converts a team-strength rank
into a time gap. `training_years` was 2022–2025, so it had **never seen a 2026
lap**, and the 2026 field is materially more spread. Every prediction all season
compressed team separation.

**Baseline.** Champion `52dd79c6`. Local artefacts verified equal to production
Supabase `car_characteristics` v101 / `driver_characteristics` v26.

**Protocol.** `scripts/champion_quali_bias.py`, 9 events x 3 seeds x 60
simulations, `--all-events`. Leakage-inclusive, so deltas only. The mapping is
prediction-time only, so both arms ran on byte-identical state with the mapping
file the single difference.

| | champion | 2026 refit |
|---|---|---|
| qualifying MAE | 2.6599 | **2.5724** |
| mean per-driver \|bias\| | 1.5017 | **1.2997** |
| qualifying slope | 1.77417 | 2.76281 |
| race slope | 1.97077 | 3.89727 |

**Why 2026-only and not pooled or recency-weighted.** Per-season slopes:

| kind | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| qualifying | 1.895 | 2.634 | 1.351 | 1.216 | **2.763** |
| race | 2.165 | 1.757 | 1.902 | 2.059 | **3.897** |

Race is a clean regime break — 2026 is nearly double any prior season. Qualifying
is **not**: 2023 reached 2.634, so 2026 is high but not unprecedented, and the
pooled 1.774 is simply the four-season mean, describing no field that ever
existed. Pooling would import pre-regulation seasons that cannot arbitrate a 2026
calibration anyway.

**The check that justifies fitting on one season.** Leave-one-round-out inside
2026, 11 folds per session kind:

| kind | slope min–max | slope sd | held-out prediction_slope | rmse |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| qualifying | 2.662–2.853 | 0.068 | 0.899 | 0.5614 |
| race | 3.813–4.040 | 0.069 | 0.973 | 0.6702 |

Dropping any single round moves the slope by at most 0.09, so the 2026 value is a
property of the season and not of particular events. Held-out calibration is
**better** than the old mapping achieved on its own seasons (mean
\|prediction_slope − 1\|: qualifying 0.101 vs 0.294, race 0.027 vs 0.093).

**Verdict: `adopted`.**

### Three things this change also fixed or exposed

- **The prior was one regeneration away from silently absorbing the current
  season.** `PriorFitConfig.historical_start/end` were recorded in the artifact
  but never applied in `_valid_fit_rows`, so putting 2026 into the shared
  observations would have pulled it into the historical teammate-network prior —
  double-counting a season the in-season updater already learns, and changing
  every seeded rating. Now enforced; verified a no-op on 2022–2025 and verified
  the prior is unchanged with 2026 present.
- **Single-season fits had no valid validation.** Leave-one-season-out
  degenerates on one training year. `evaluate_within_season_folds` adds
  leave-one-round-out, and the frozen artefact now reports it as
  `primary_folds` when fitted on one season, marking the cross-season folds as
  provenance only.
- **The golden fixtures are tolerance-based, not exact.** They passed through
  both this change and the reverted one on 2026-08-03. Passing them does not mean
  predictions are unchanged — they bound position drift and top-N overlap, so
  they catch gross regressions, not recalibration.

### Closed the same day

Both open items below were resolved; kept here so the sequence is legible.

- ~~The race mapping is unvalidated against race results.~~ **Measured** — see
  the next entry. It helps.
- ~~`training_years` needs a policy, not a constant.~~ **Now
  `model.regulation_eras`.**
- 2026 has 11 rounds and 181 qualifying calibration rows. Re-run this fit as the
  season extends; the slope is stable so far, but that is 11 rounds of evidence.

## 2026-08-04: validate the race half, and scope calibration to a regulation era — `adopted`

The refit above changed a race slope nobody had scored, and pinned
`training_years` to a constant that would be wrong at the next regulation change.
This closes both.

**Race validation.** `scripts/champion_race_bias.py` is new: the qualifying
scorer cannot see the race slope at all, so half the refit was unmeasured. Each
event is predicted **from its actual starting grid** rather than a predicted one,
so qualifying error cannot leak into the number. 9 events x 3 seeds x 60
simulations, same leakage on both arms:

| | 2022–25 mapping | 2026 refit | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| race MAE | 4.0606 | **3.9192** | **−0.1414** |
| race mean \|bias\| | 2.4242 | **2.3434** | −0.0808 |

The race half helps by more in absolute terms than the qualifying half did
(−0.141 vs −0.088). Both halves of the refit are now measured against a control.

**Era policy.** `model.regulation_eras` replaces the `DEFAULT_TRAINING_YEARS`
constant. Calibration is scoped to one era and never fitted across a boundary.
When regulations change, adding an era and closing the previous `end_year` is the
whole change — the refit follows. `--training-years` still overrides for one-off
fits. Freezing through the policy reproduces `[2026]` and identical slopes, so
adopting it changed no numbers.

### Field compaction: expected, not yet measurable, and now detectable

Teams converge within a regulation era, the field compacts, and a frozen slope
becomes progressively too steep. How fast is unknown.

**No decay weighting was applied, deliberately.** It is not measurable yet.
Across 11 rounds of 2026 the per-round slope sd is **~0.73**, and non-overlapping
thirds are not monotone in either session kind:

| kind | rounds 1–4 | 5–8 | 9–11 |
|---|---|---|---|
| qualifying | 2.481 | 3.013 | 2.777 |
| race | 4.420 | 3.292 | 4.082 |

A trend estimate over 11 rounds at that scatter carries a standard error near
0.067, so the −0.10/round "compaction" an earlier rolling-window pass appeared to
show was about one standard error, and was an artefact of overlapping windows.
**That claim was retracted rather than built on** — fitting a decay to it would
have repeated the 2026-08-03 mistake.

A drift diagnostic (`evaluate_slope_drift`) was built to watch for it — recent
window against the era fit, in standard errors of per-round scatter — and then
**removed the same day**. It measured 0.14 SE (race) and 0.96 SE
(qualifying), i.e. nothing, which is the point: it was monitoring for a
phenomenon this very section establishes is not detectable yet, and any refit
would recompute the fit anyway. Building a detector before there is anything to
detect is speculation, not rigour.

What remains is the check that catches the failure that *does* happen: rounds
accumulate, nobody refreezes, and the committed mapping stops describing its own
calibration rows. See `tests/test_team_strength_mapping_freshness.py`.

So the answer to "how long until compaction matters" is: unknown, not yet
measurable, and **refit as rounds accumulate rather than trying to predict it**.
The freshness test makes that automatic by failing when the mapping falls behind
its own data.

### Open after this

- The race scorer takes roughly 15 minutes per arm against ~4 for qualifying, so
  race A/Bs are not free the way qualifying ones are.
- Still 11 rounds. Every conclusion here is 11 rounds deep.

### The staleness guard

The failure that actually happens is mundane: rounds accumulate, nobody
refreezes, and the committed mapping stops describing its own calibration rows.
`tests/test_team_strength_mapping_freshness.py` fails the build when refitting on
the current rows no longer reproduces the frozen slope, judged against per-round
scatter rather than a fixed tolerance, at three standard errors.

It was originally two guards; the second watched the drift diagnostic and went
with it. **Verified to fire, not merely to pass** — perturbing the committed
qualifying slope by 40% reports `4.9 standard errors apart. Re-run
scripts/freeze_team_strength_seconds_mapping.py`. A freshness test that cannot
fail reads as coverage while providing none.

Both judge against per-round scatter rather than a fixed tolerance. Staleness
fails at three standard errors, one above the diagnostic's own two-standard-error
prompt, so ordinary round-to-round movement does not break the build.

**The guard was verified to fire, not just to pass.** Perturbing the committed
qualifying slope by 40% fails with `4.9 standard errors apart. Re-run
scripts/freeze_team_strength_seconds_mapping.py`. A freshness test that cannot
fail is worse than none, because it reads as coverage.

`latest.md` now carries the drift table too, so the numbers are visible to
someone reading the artefact rather than only to `json.load`.

## 2026-08-05: the qualifying seconds-to-score scale was never coupled to the mapping — `adopted`

**The thesis.** Qualifying projects the team-strength seconds delta into its
latent `[0, 1]` score space by dividing by `team_strength_seconds_score_scale`.
That divisor was a frozen config constant, so the 2026-08-04 refit moved the
mapping and the consumer did not follow. Deriving it from the live qualifying
slope fixes the coupling permanently.

**Two defects, stacked.** The constant was `1.9707717329051126`. That is exactly
the pre-refit **race** slope, to the last digit — a different session's
calibration, used on the qualifying path since `0590c376` (2026-05-19). The
refit then froze it in place while the qualifying slope moved 1.7742 -> 2.7628.

**This supersedes a claim recorded above.** The 2026-07-31 section "The clip is
binding, at the front of the grid" concluded: "The team term alone cannot reach a
bound — it spans only +/-0.42 against a +/-0.5 threshold — so every clip event
needs the driver term to push it over." That was true when measured. It is no
longer. Under the refitted slope Mercedes at strength 0.901 projects to 0.562 on
the team term alone, so the team term now clips **without any driver
contribution**. Both the slope increase and the move from 6-round to 11-round
strengths contributed.

**Measured saturation**, live Dutch GP state, all 22 drivers:

| scale | drivers hitting a bound |
|---|---|
| 1.9708 frozen (shipped 2026-08-04) | **7 / 22** — LEC, HAM, RUS, ANT, STR, PER, BOT |
| 1.9708 under the *pre-refit* slope | 1 / 22 — STR only |
| 2.7628 derived (this change) | **0 / 22** |

Saturation is not cosmetic: both teammates pin to the identical value, so the
learned `quali_rating_mu_s` is erased. Mercedes lost 0.200s of RUS/ANT
separation, Cadillac 0.288s, Ferrari 0.020s. Ferrari and Mercedes both pinned to
exactly 1.000, so the seconds channel could not separate the two teams at all.

**Why the qualifying slope is the right divisor, not a fitted constant.**
`delta = slope * (team_strength - 0.5)`, so `delta / slope` recovers the centred
team strength exactly and the driver rating enters as `mu / slope`. The signal
is then inside `[0, 1]` by construction for any team strength in `[0, 1]`. Any
other divisor either saturates the clip or wastes the range.

**Baseline.** Champion `76d26fcf`, working tree clean, in sync with origin.

**Protocol.** `scripts/champion_quali_bias.py --all-events`, 9 events x 3 seeds x
20 simulations. Leakage-inclusive, so deltas only. Arms varied through
`F1_CONFIG` alone; no state replay, no artifact was touched.

| | champion (1.9708) | derived (2.7628) |
|---|---|---|
| qualifying MAE | 2.5758 | **2.5556** |
| mean per-driver \|bias\| | 1.2862 | **1.2660** |

**The MAE gain is not evidence and is not claimed as one.** A nine-point sweep
of the scale gives:

| scale | 1.9708 | 2.2 | 2.4 | 2.606 | 2.8 | 3.069 | 3.3 | 3.7 | 4.2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MAE | 2.5758 | 2.5791 | 2.5791 | 2.5791 | **2.5488** | 2.5623 | 2.5657 | 2.5892 | 2.6027 |
| \|bias\| | 1.2862 | 1.2795 | 1.3064 | 1.2761 | 1.2559 | 1.2559 | 1.2458 | **1.2290** | 1.2458 |

Three different scales return byte-identical MAE 2.5791, because MAE over
integer grid positions is a step function. There is no bowl: 2.8 is an isolated
dip with 3.069 and 3.3 both worse. The whole sweep spans 0.054, so the adopted
arm's 0.0202 sits inside the jitter. Picking the sweep minimum would be fitting
9 events x 3 seeds. Per-driver `|bias|` is the smoother, broadly monotone series
and is the metric the mechanism actually predicts, since it measures exactly the
driver ratings that saturation erases.

**Adopted on the structural argument, not the metric.** The measurement is
neutral-to-slightly-positive and is recorded as such. The reason to take it is
that the two values were never coupled, so every future refit silently
re-saturates until someone notices.

**Race side is unaffected.** `lap_by_lap_simulator.py` consumes the seconds delta
and `race_rating_mu_s` natively in seconds — no projection, no clip — so despite
the race slope moving further (1.9708 -> 3.8973) it cannot saturate. The bounded
score space is a legacy of qualifying's latent-ranking design.

**Guarded.** `tests/test_team_strength_mapping_freshness.py` gains three tests:
the resolved scale must equal the live qualifying slope, must not be the race
slope, and no team strength in `[0.02, 0.98]` may project onto a clip bound. The
freshness tests above guard the artifact against its calibration rows; these
guard it against its consumer, which is how this defect survived. Verified to
fire, not merely to pass: under the old constant the scale test fails and the
saturation test trips at 2 of 5 sampled strengths.

**Do not hardcode this value again.** An explicit config number still overrides,
so an A/B arm costs no code change — that is what the sweep above used.

## 2026-08-24: qualifying classification is not the starting grid — `never activated` on the replay, `adopted` for the residual dataset

**The thesis.** Nothing in this repo read FastF1's `GridPosition`. Every path that
needed a race start position used the qualifying classification instead, which
carries no penalties: a driver who qualifies P3 and takes a ten-place drop is still
classified P3 by the timing feed. `fetch_actual_starting_grid()` in
`src/data/actual_results_fetcher.py` is the first producer of the real grid, and of
the `start_type` field the `QualifyingGridEntry` type has declared and validated
since it was written with nothing ever setting it.

**Baseline.** `19085bd5`, rebuilt — a fresh 12-round 2026 walk-forward replay, not the
stored artifact. Both arms carry the practice-session tolerance below, so the only
difference between them is the starting grid.

**How wrong the classification is, in 2026.** 41 of 264 driver-races, 15.5%, disagree
with the real grid. The error distribution in positions:

| error | -11 | -10 | -4 | -3 | -1 | +1 | +2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| rows | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 18 | 12 |

Most are one-or-two-place cascades behind someone else's penalty. Seven rows exceed
the residual model's own +/-2.5 target clip, and the two worst — Spa, where NOR
qualified P3 and started P13, and HAD P10 -> P21 — saturate it in the wrong direction.

**Replay: `never activated`.** Baseline and grid arms produced identical race MAE at
all 42 shared checkpoints — mean 3.8468 both, zero difference to four decimals. The
reason is structural, not marginal: every replay checkpoint is pre-qualifying
(`PRE`, `FP1`, `FP2`, `FP3`, `SQ`), so the replay always predicts the grid and never
reads a classification as a start position. The swap in
`_resolve_race_section_for_replay` is guarded on `qualifying_grid_source == "ACTUAL"`
and correctly never fires. **This corrects a claim made while planning the change** —
that the ledger's race MAE was partly scored against grids that never happened. It
was not. The replay was never exposed to this defect.

**Residual dataset: `adopted`.** `build_race_residual_dataset` built both the
`grid_position` feature and the `target_positions_gained` label from the qualifying
classification, so 15.5% of its rows were labelled with positions the driver never
gained or lost. It now builds both from the starting grid. Unmeasured against a
scored run: `baseline_predictor.race.race_residual_model.enabled` is `false`, so this
changes no live prediction today. It changes what the model learns the next time
anyone evaluates it, which is the point.

**A separate fix the replay needed first.** FastF1 publishes 2026 Barcelona FP1 with
laps but no team names — confirmed by deleting the cache entry and refetching from
the live API: 22 drivers, 544 laps, every `TeamName` empty. It is the only session in
the 2026 season with zero team names. `_apply_session_update` raised on it, so the
whole season replay aborted at round 7 and wrote no checkpoints. Practice sessions now
degrade: the failure is logged, recorded in `HistoricalReplaySummary.skipped_sessions`,
and the replay continues. Testing days and competitive sessions still fail closed —
a season seed or a scored result built on missing data is not a replay. Both arms
above record `skipped_sessions: ['Barcelona Grand Prix::FP1']`.

**Indicative side measurement, not walk-forward.** Predicting each 2026 round directly
from the two grids, 3 seeds x 100 simulations, scored against the actual finish: the
six affected rounds averaged -0.056 MAE with the real grid (Spa -0.242, Hungary
+0.242), and all six unaffected rounds were identical to three decimals. The unaffected
rounds matching exactly is the control that matters; the -0.056 is inside noise and
is not a claim.

## 2026-08-26: track difficulty must cap pass probability, not merely nudge it — `adopted`

**The thesis.** In the lap-by-lap simulator, track difficulty entered pass probability only as
an additive threshold, and the pace term swamped it. At Monaco, for a car 3.4 s/lap quicker
than the one ahead:

    overtake_score   = pace_delta * 0.55 = 1.87
    pass_threshold   = 0.06 + 0.95 * 0.16 = 0.21
    pass_probability = 0.30 + (1.87 - 0.21) * 0.45 = 1.05  ->  clipped to 0.95

A quick car passed 95% of the time on the least passable circuit in F1. Track difficulty was
outweighed roughly nine to one. The fix caps the probability with the track's own observed
rate: `overtaking_avg_changes_per_lap / (field_size - 1)`, i.e. field-wide position changes
per lap divided by the number of following pairs. Measured pass rates for a 4 s/lap advantage
in a 22-car field: Monaco 0.048, Monza 0.142, Spa 0.200; a track with no observed-change data
keeps the previous 0.95 ceiling rather than guessing.

**Baseline.** `c7623714`, rebuilt: mean race MAE 3.6136 over the 12 completed 2026 rounds,
each predicted from its actual qualifying classification, 100 simulations, seed 42, scored
against actual finishing positions.

**Result — 3.6136 -> 3.5909.** A modest improvement, and it is recorded as modest.

**What was measured and rejected.** A queue invariant — a driver who failed a pass could not
end the lap ahead of the car he failed to pass, enforced on cumulative time — scored better
still, 3.5152. It was rejected because the full test suite showed it broke four pre-existing
behaviours that all pass on champion:

| test | failure |
|---|---|
| `test_higher_skill_driver_wins_majority_of_intra_team_battles` | 58.8% vs 60% required |
| `test_high_sc_probability_produces_variance` | zero upsets |
| `test_race_simulation_uses_mapped_team_seconds_delta` | faster car finished second |
| `test_race_simulation_uses_seconds_native_driver_residual` | faster car finished second |

A safety car bunching the field and producing zero upsets is wrong: SC restarts are a primary
overtaking mechanism, and especially so at Monaco. **The 0.0984 MAE gain was bought with
physically false behaviour, and MAE alone did not reveal it** — only the qualitative tests did.
Recorded here so the number is not rediscovered and adopted later without its cost. None of the
four tests set `overtaking_avg_changes_per_lap`, so the cap adopted above is inactive in all of
them and is not implicated.

**Known limitation.** A Mercedes penalised to P22 is predicted P5 at Monza, P8 in Hungary and
P9 at Monaco — correct ordering, but Monaco is roughly 4-6 places optimistic. The cause is not
the passing model: it is attrition. The simulator produces 3.1 retirements per Monaco race
against 6 in the actual 2026 event. Real 2026 Monaco has the season's second-highest mean
grid-to-finish movement (3.88 places, behind Britain's 4.05) precisely because six cars
retired, not because anyone overtook. That is DNF calibration; see `shelved/dnf-calibration`.

**Unresolved.** `overtaking_avg_changes_per_lap` and `overtaking_difficulty` carry
`overtaking_observed_races: 0` for all 25 tracks. Both are static priors this repo has never
validated against a race, and the adopted cap now rests on one of them.

## 2026-08-26: the 2026 overtaking rates, measured — `adopted`

**The thesis.** The pass cap adopted in the entry below divides
`overtaking_avg_changes_per_lap` by the number of following pairs. That input was a static
prior derived from 2022-2024 races, carried in `2025_track_characteristics.json` with
`overtaking_observed_races: 0` — never validated against a race — while
`2026_track_characteristics.json` recorded it for none of its 25 circuits. A 2026 model was
being capped by pre-regulation-change cars.

**Measured from cached FastF1 lap data**, using the original prior's exact counting rule
(skip lap 1, drop pit-out laps, skip laps with fewer than five cars, count every driver whose
position changed — so one overtake counts twice):

| race | 2026 | prior | race | 2026 | prior |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| Australian | 2.30 | 2.81 | British | 3.14 | 2.53 |
| Chinese | 3.20 | 4.53 | Belgian | 3.16 | 5.15 |
| Japanese | 2.83 | 3.68 | Hungarian | 3.39 | 3.27 |
| Miami | 2.80 | 3.14 | Dutch | 3.56 | 3.11 |
| Canadian | 2.21 | 2.28 | Monaco | 1.26 | 1.12 |
| Austrian | 2.80 | 3.38 | Barcelona | 3.62 | n/a |

**The prior is not wrong — it measured a different formula.** Nine of eleven comparable
circuits sit lower in 2026 and the spread compresses from 4.03 to 2.36. That is the
regulation change appearing in the data, the same reason `model.regulation_eras` scopes the
seconds mapping. `scripts/extract_overtaking_rates.py` now measures a season and writes the
value with an `overtaking_observed_races` count; the loader blends toward the previous era's
value using the existing transition weighting, so with one race per circuit the 2026
measurement earns roughly 12-19% weight.

**Result — 3.5909 -> 3.5606** over the 12 completed rounds against the rebuilt `c7623714`
baseline of 3.6136.

**Worth knowing.** Belgium resolves to 4.78 from a previous-era 5.15 and a 2026 measurement of
3.16. After a full season the input has moved about a fifth of the way. The transition
schedule (`races_to_full_weight: 8`) was built for drift within an era, not for an era break;
whether it should adapt faster after a regulation change is an open question, and it also
governs `overtaking_difficulty`.

## 2026-08-26: retirements, both layers — `adopted`, and a probe whose evidence failed

**The thesis.** Actual 2026 retirements, read from raw FastF1 (`ClassifiedPosition` not
numeric): **42 in 264 driver-races, 0.201 per driver-race, 4.42 per race.** Against that:

| layer | before | after | actual |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| simulator input `dnf_probability` (field sum) | 3.13 | 4.43 | 4.42 |
| reported `dnf_probability` (mean) | 0.064 | 0.200 | 0.201 |

The simulator retired too few cars and the output layer then shrank the reported risk to a
third of reality. A user reading "6% retirement risk" was looking at a one-in-five event.

**The probe that justified the shrinkage was scored against incomplete actuals.**
`data/model_diagnostics/2026/dnf_calibration_probe.md` recorded **11 DNFs across 13 events**;
raw FastF1 for the same races has **42**. Its per-event counts read zero for Australia, China,
Japan, Miami, Canada and Monaco, all of which had between 2 and 7 retirements; only the last
three events it scored are correct. The signature is actuals attached before
`scripts/backfill_dnf_data.py` existed.

Re-scored on complete actuals (264 driver-races, true rate 0.201), pooled Brier by lambda:

| lambda | 0.00 | 0.25 | 0.50 | 0.75 | 1.00 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Brier (true rate 0.201) | 0.16045 | 0.16086 | 0.16362 | 0.16875 | 0.17622 |
| Brier (probe's 0.038) | 0.18694 | 0.18409 | 0.18135 | 0.17873 | 0.17622 |

Under the probe's understated base rate, Brier improves monotonically as lambda rises — the
opposite ranking to the one it reported. Its lambda=0.25 optimum, and the deployed knob's
justification that "the raw output overforecasts retirement risk", are artifacts of the
missing retirements. **The direction was backwards: the model under-forecasts.**

**What changed.** `dnf_probability_base_rate` 0.04 -> 0.20, the observed rate.
`dnf_probability_shrinkage_lambda` stays 0.25 — with a correct target it now blends toward
reality, and Brier there is within 0.0004 of the best value. A single documented
`dnf_season_calibration_multiplier` (1.415) scales the per-driver probability fed to the Monte
Carlo so the field expectation matches the observed rate; it multiplies, so relative driver
ordering survives, and the existing cap and floor still bind.

**Cost — 3.5606 -> 3.5758.** Retirements are the least predictable event in a race, so
simulating them at the true rate necessarily adds variance. The trade is 0.015 race MAE for a
retirement model that is no longer wrong by a factor of three. Still 0.038 better than
champion.

**Not fixed.** The probe's own `.md` and `.json` are generated from production-stored
predictions that are not reachable locally, so they still show the old numbers. Re-running the
probe needs the stored actuals backfilled in production first.

**Per-track attrition was considered and rejected as unfittable.** Actual 2026 retirements per
race range 2 to 7, but the observed standard deviation (1.68) is *smaller* than Poisson noise
for a mean of 4.4 (2.10). With one race per circuit there is no track signal to fit, only
randomness. The global rate above is fitted to 264 driver-races; a per-track multiplier would
be fitting noise.

## 2026-08-26: teammate setup offset into base pace — `worse`, built and reverted

**The thesis.** The persistent half of the teammate spread is added to lap time after
`base_pace` is cached, so it never reaches `pace_delta_to_ahead`. A persistently quicker
teammate never registered as quicker and never attempted an overtake. Moving it into
`base_lap_time` leaves total lap time identical and makes it visible to the overtake model.

**Result — 3.5758 -> 3.6439, worse than champion (3.6136). Reverted.**

**Why it should have been obvious.** The offset is `rng.normal(0, std)` — a random per-driver
draw, not measured pace. Feeding it to the overtake model converts noise into position
changes. The code sits the way it does on purpose; a comment at the call site now says so with
this number attached, because the shape of the code invites the same "fix" again.

## 2026-08-28: position changes were not caused by passing — `adopted` (anchor removal), `candidate` (queue invariant)

**The thesis.** A penalised driver's predicted recovery was wrong: ANT was reported finishing P3
from a P22 start. Chasing why exposed that position changes in the lap-by-lap simulator are not
caused by passing at all — position is derived from cumulative lap time, so cars cross over
whether or not the pass model fires.

**Root cause, measured.** Counting successful pass events against position changes over 10
simulations per circuit:

| circuit | passes | changes | rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Monaco | 46 | 2949 | 1.6% |
| Hungarian | 196 | 3151 | 6.2% |
| Belgian | 357 | 2715 | 13.1% |

Even at Belgium, the circuit with the most passing measured, 87% of position changes happen
without a pass event.

**Baseline.** `566b5d3b`, rebuilt: mean race MAE **3.5758** over the 12 completed 2026 rounds,
each predicted from its actual qualifying classification, 100 simulations, seed 42.

**Consequence — four measured dead ends.** Each moved the churn ratio by about 1%, none moved it
meaningfully toward target:

| change | result |
|---|---|
| pass-probability cap by contending pairs alone | MAE 3.5833 (worse) |
| dirty air raised to its measured magnitude, ~24x | churn ratio 1.76 -> 1.74 |
| per-circuit field spread from lap-1 timing | churn ratio 1.76 -> 1.69 |
| pass probability scaled to 0.10 (90% cut) | churn ratio 1.76 -> 1.75 |

None of these touch the mechanism: position derives from time, not from the pass model, so
tuning the pass model tunes something the position order barely reads.

**Adopted — `resolve_pace_anchor` deleted.** It restored a penalised driver's qualifying
position as his finish-order anchor, silently erasing the penalty — the actual cause of ANT P3.
Removing it changes ANT from P3 to P18 from a P22 start and costs **zero** MAE (3.5758 -> 3.5758,
identical to four decimals), because no round in the 12-round scored set carries a penalty.

**Candidate, not adopted — queue invariant plus contending-pairs cap.** Gates a position change
on a completed pass, exempting pitted cars, retired cars and neutralised laps. **MAE 3.5758 ->
3.5227**. At the time of measurement, recovery from P22 gave Monza P16, Hungary P18, Monaco P20,
with a slow car (BOT) staying P22 at all three. Calibration metrics all moved toward target
without reaching it: displacement ratio 2.07 -> 1.76, churn ratio 1.76 -> 1.25, churn correlation
+0.273 -> +0.453 against a target of 0.617.

Each component measured **worse alone** — cap 3.5833, gating 3.6364 — so the combined 3.5227 may
be two errors partly cancelling rather than a validated joint fix. **However, see the MAE note
below: none of these differences is distinguishable at n=12.**

Test cost at the time: 4 behavioural failures. Three were plumbing tests reading pace through
free passing and have since been re-pointed at lap time; the fourth,
`test_higher_skill_driver_wins_majority_of_intra_team_battles` at 58.8% against a 60% floor, was
a real signal and is resolved by the skill calibration in the 2026-08-29 entry. **Now adopted**,
with the full suite green.

**MAE cannot arbitrate between any of these variants.** Per-race MAE over the 12 scored rounds has
sd 1.339, so the standard error of the mean is 0.387. Every configuration measured this session —
3.5152, 3.5227, 3.5758, 3.5833, 3.6364 — lies within 0.16 SE of champion, where 0.758 would be
needed to clear two standard errors. MAE is a guard against catastrophe here, not a discriminator;
every decision in this work was made on the physics metrics instead.

**Measurement corrections.** Two earlier figures were inflated by a harness that patched
`simulate_race_lap_by_lap` on the utils module; that function is injected via `deps` and bound in
`prediction_mixin`, so the patch never fired and per-run state never reset. Corrected: churn
ratio 2.01 -> 1.76, churn correlation +0.389 -> +0.273.

**Reliability limits.** Churn reliability is 0.595 across circuits against a ceiling of 0.771, so
a correlation target above about 0.62 is unreachable at one race per circuit. Displacement
reliability is **negative** (-0.223): its between-circuit differences are entirely within
sampling noise, so no per-track displacement criterion is evaluable until a second season
exists.

**Recovery evidence, 2022-2025** (n=401 driver-races starting P15 or worse, classified finishers,
grid and finish ranked within the finishers, bucketed by the driver's median finish across his
other races that season):

| car quality | n | median | p75 | p90 | max |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| top car (season median finish <= 6) | 31 | +7 | +10 | +13 | +13 |
| upper-mid (6 < median <= 11) | 99 | +3 | +5 | +8 | +12 |
| backmarker (median > 11) | 271 | +1 | +3 | +4 | +12 |

2026 only, top car, n=2: HAD P21 -> P6 (+12), VER P20 -> P6 (+9). Largest top-car recoveries
2022-2025: RUS P20 -> P6 (+13), LEC P19 -> P3 (+13), VER P15 -> P2 (+12), LEC P19 -> P5 (+12).

**Verdict.** Anchor removal: `adopted`. Queue invariant plus contending-pairs cap: `candidate`,
pending a decision on the four failing tests.

## 2026-08-29: the blend was discarding a correct simulation — `adopted`, model version 3.0

**The thesis.** With position changes gated on a completed pass, the simulator recovers a
penalised driver realistically on its own: traced lap by lap at Monza, ANT climbs P22 -> P14 by
lap 4, P10 by lap 12, P4 by lap 48. The reported finish was P17. Three damping heuristics were
each discarding that answer, all justified by "a grid slot proxies pace" — which is false for a
driver a steward moved.

**Baseline.** `566b5d3b`, race MAE 3.5758 over the 12 completed 2026 rounds, 100 simulations,
seed 42.

**What was removed, for penalised drivers only.** `resolve_pace_anchor` replaced the anchor with
the qualifying position, erasing the penalty (ANT P3). Deleting it left the grid anchor charging
the penalty twice — started at P22 and anchored at P22 — giving P17. The `max_gain` floor,
`max(1, grid - 11)`, would have clamped the result at P11 regardless. All three are now bypassed
for a driver carrying an `is_penalised` flag; every other driver's blend is untouched, which the
MAE control confirms.

**A flag, deliberately, not a substitute position.** Replacing the grid slot with the qualifying
slot is what made the pace anchor dangerous. A boolean cannot erase a penalty.

**Team race pace, measured instead of inferred.** `team_strength` is reconstructed from classified
results (`_get_current_season_observations`), which conflate pace with reliability, strategy and
luck, and it fed `base_pace` — a lap-time quantity. The simulator had Red Bull fastest with
Mercedes third at +0.240; measured 2026 race pace has Mercedes fastest and Red Bull fourth at
+0.750. `scripts/extract_team_race_pace.py` now measures median green-flag lap time per team per
race, normalised to the fastest team, and `_resolve_team_pace_delta_seconds` prefers it, falling
back to the results-derived mapping when absent.

**Driver skill, fitted to two independent measurements.** `skill_improvement_max` 0.75 -> 1.75.

| target | measured | model at 0.75 | model at 1.75 |
|---|---|---|---|
| team mate lap-time gap (114 team-races) | median 0.352 s/lap | 0.150 s | 0.350 s |
| stronger driver's win rate (34 team-seasons) | median 0.667 | 0.546 | 0.692 |

Two unrelated statistics converge on the same value, which is the reason to trust it over a
single fitted target. It also lowers the team:driver influence ratio from 2.33 to 1.00, well
inside the repo's 2.40 cap, and leaves equal-skill team mates at 0.471.

**Result.**

```
ANT P22 ->  Monza P7   Hungary P7   Monaco P8     (champion: P3 / P4 / P5)
BOT P22 ->  Monza P18  Hungary P20  Monaco P20
MAE 3.5758 -> 3.5152   (0.16 SE — not a distinguishable difference)
suite 1762 passed, 5 skipped, 3 xfailed, 0 failed
```

For scale: a top car starting at the back finishes P3-P6 in reality (HAD P21->P6 and VER P20->P6
in 2026; SAI P18->P4 at Monza 2022). P7-P8 from one place further back is in range.

**Watch this.** BOT — the slowest car — drifted P22 -> P19 -> P18 at Monza across the three
changes. Each step is inside the measured envelope for a back-of-grid start (median +2, p90 +9 at
Monza), but the cumulative trend was never examined and no single measurement flags it.

**A measurement error worth not repeating.** The recovery bound this work was first scored against
pooled every start from P15 or worse. That pool is 271 of 401 backmarkers, which dragged the p90
to 4.8 places and made a correct P16 prediction look pessimistic — and sent this work toward a
team-strength refit it did not need. Bucketed by car quality the top-car median is +7 and the
four-season maximum +13. Pooling a conditional quantity is the same error class as fitting a
per-track value to single-race noise.

## 2026-09-04: car x track fit — `rejected`; season-form construct — `candidate`

**Why this was opened.** A user report that the model "overweights recent performance instead of
getting the characteristics of the car vs track". Two separable claims: that a car x track term is
missing, and that the recency weighting is too aggressive.

**Car x track fit is not recoverable — do not retry with layout features.** Leave-one-race-out over
`team_strength_seconds_mapping/calibration_observations.csv`: estimate a team's offset from its
other races, predict its residual at a held-out race, permutation null that keeps the estimator's
structure and destroys only the real car-track correspondence.

| season | races | race | qualifying |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2022 | 19 | -4.9% (p=0.72) | -6.2% (p=0.76) |
| 2023 | 21 | -5.1% (p=0.80) | -3.7% (p=0.61) |
| 2024 | 22 | -4.6% (p=0.73) | -3.5% (p=0.45) |
| 2025 | 22 | -1.4% (p=0.25) | -9.8% (p=0.96) |
| 2026 | 10 | **+12.1% (p=0.034)** | -14.7% (p=0.93) |

Negative skill in 9 of 10 cells, including four seasons where round count is not the binding
constraint. The single positive sits at the smallest sample and was found by sweeping 6 layout axes
x 4 shrinkage values x 2 session kinds — 48 looks, against a null 95th percentile of +11.4%. It does
not survive selection. Archetype binning was also tested and was indistinguishable from shuffled
labels (p = 0.44-0.67).

**Consequence.** `calculate_track_suitability` was retired from `get_blended_team_strength`. Its
weight was already 0.00 from race 4 onward under `rapid_adaptive`, so the term was annihilated for
most of every season while the docstring claimed it was blended. The method is kept because
`qualifying_residual_model` still uses it as a feature. Races 1-3 shift by
`w_testing * track_suitability`, bounded at about 0.005 at race 1 — the suitability term's
best-to-worst-track swing is at most 0.023 team-strength units across all 11 teams x 23 track
profiles, and most of `directionality` is a per-team level offset rather than car shape (Aston
Martin is negative on all four axes, McLaren positive on all four).

**Recency exponent 1.8 -> 0.3 — `candidate`, directional only.** Walk-forward over 2026, affine map
fitted on training races, scored in seconds on the held-out race. The response is monotone in both
session kinds, which is the opposite of the non-monotone jitter that invalidated the
`grid_anchor_weight` two-arm delta.

| exponent | race MAE | qualifying MAE |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0 | 0.6583s | 0.5670s |
| 0.9 | 0.6676s | 0.5747s |
| 1.8 (was shipped) | 0.6775s | 0.5851s |
| 2.5 | 0.6824s | 0.5902s |

0.3 was chosen over the measured-best 0.0 to retain some sensitivity to in-season upgrades. A
team-clustered bootstrap on the 1.8 -> 0.0 delta includes zero in both session kinds
(race [-0.0212, +0.0553], qualifying [-0.0113, +0.0481]). **Not scored against a rebuilt baseline
yet** — this entry records the lever's shape, not an adoption.

**The finding that matters more than either change: team strength is a rank statistic end to end.**
`score_teams_from_actual_rows` emits `1 - rank_index/(team_count-1)`, so the fastest team scores
exactly 1.0 and the slowest exactly 0.0 every race regardless of gap size. The same collapse is in
the calibration dataset the seconds mapping was fitted on: `team_strength_mapping.py:201` computes
`team_median_s` — a real seconds value — and discards it on the next line by ranking. All 374 2026
rows carry only 27 distinct values, every one a small fraction k/(n-1). This is why margin scoring
has lost twice: the slope it gets converted through was never fitted on margin, so the arm measures
a units error. **Refitting the mapping with a margin-native predictor is the prerequisite**, and
`scripts/extract_team_race_pace.py` (added 2026-08-29) already produces the per-team green-flag
median the refit needs. It also explains the car x track null above: rank cannot express "0.3s
better here", so a track term could not register even if one existed.

**DNF exclusion from season form — `candidate`.** `score_teams_from_actual_rows` had no DNF filter,
so a car that retired on lap 3 and was classified P19 scored as a slow car; the 2026-08-29 entry
already noted this construct "conflate[s] pace with reliability, strategy and luck". `row_is_dnf`
moved to `src/utils/accuracy_targets.py` and now gates the position mean, handling all three row
shapes the sanitizer emits (`dnf`, `status`, `classified`). Verified byte-identical on all 28 stored
2026 artifact target-sets while none carried a DNF signal, which is what the fix shipping dormant
looked like.

**The cutover was done, not deferred.** Shipping dormant would have let one team's observation
series mix two scoring conventions at the round the first flag appeared, with nothing recording
which element used which. `scripts/backfill_dnf_data.py --year 2026 --predictions-dir
supabase_artifacts/predictions` wrote **62 DNF row-labels across 11 files and re-derived zero
probabilities**, so no current-model state leaked into historical artifacts. Those 11 files are
checkpoint variants of only **3 distinct races** locally (Australia, China incl. sprint, Japan),
so 62 is a row-label count, not 62 separate retirements - the distinct figure is about 18. `data/predictions`
was deliberately NOT backfilled: it holds one qualifying file whose only change would have been
2 probabilities filled from the modified model. Artifacts are untracked, so they were archived to
`~/Documents/trackside-labs-archive/predictions_pre_dnf_backfill_20260904_231119.tar.gz` first.

**Size of the contamination, measured.** Re-scoring every artifact before and after, 14 of 28
target-sets moved and all 14 are race or sprint (qualifying carries no DNF concept and is
provably untouched). Australian GP, 6 retirements: McLaren 0.5 -> 0.8, Red Bull 0.4 -> 0.7,
Haas 0.8 -> 0.6, Alpine 0.6 -> 0.3. Moves of 0.3 on a 0-1 scale, on the series that carries 95%
of team strength from race 4. Retirements were scoring fast cars as slow ones and the recency
weighting was amplifying it — which is the mechanism behind the original "overweights recent
performance" report, more than the exponent was. Two known ceilings, both commented in
source: a team whose cars all retired keeps its unfiltered rows and still scores last, and a team
scored on one surviving car is not comparable to one scored on two — the telemetry path has an
entered-field guard for exactly this and the saved-actual path does not.

## 2026-09-04: prediction-path stress pass — three unreported defects, one dominant

Adversarial probes over the team-strength path, run against real 2026 data rather than by reading.
Scripts were scratch; the numbers are reproducible from
`data/processed/team_strength_seconds_mapping/calibration_observations.csv` plus the stored artifacts.

**Invariants that hold.** All 8 schedules sum to 1.0 at every race number and never go negative;
current-season weight is monotone in race number; `score_teams_from_actual_rows` is permutation
invariant over row order and never scores a worse finish higher; replay observations are instance
state and cannot leak into production.

**1. Rank quantization costs 0.605s RMS, and it dominates everything else measured.** Round-tripping
each 2026 session's real per-team gap through the rank score and back out via the fitted slope:

| | race | qualifying |
|---|---|---|
| RMS error | **0.605s** | 0.522s |
| mean absolute error | 0.464s | 0.376s |
| worst | 2.019s | 1.731s |
| real median adjacent-team gap | 0.302s | 0.234s |
| gap the model assigns (constant) | 0.476s | 0.362s |
| adjacent pairs where model gap > 4x reality | 20/90 (22%) | 19/84 (23%) |

The whole race field spans 3.897s, so the representation error is ~15% of the field per team per
race. **For scale: the recency-exponent change adopted the same day is worth 0.019s.** Rank costs
about 25x more than the knob that was tuned. One position swap moves a team 1/(n-1) = 0.100 units =
**0.390s** at the race slope, regardless of whether the real gap changed by 0.01s or 1.0s. This is
the quantified form of the "overweights recent performance" report and it is a representation
defect, not a weighting one.

**2. Two different constructs share one 0-1 scale, and which one a team gets is decided by list
length, per team.** `_get_current_season_observations` returns whichever of `live_observations`
(telemetry/position pace) or `saved_actual_observations` (rank) is longer, via
`_prefer_longest_observations`, and it is called once per team. Measured on the stored 2026 payload
the two sources disagree by a mean of **0.098 team-strength units (0.38s)**, max **0.308 (1.20s,
Audi; Williams 1.11s)**. In the current artifact **McLaren is scored on rank while the other ten
teams are scored on pace**, because its live and saved lists are both length 1 and the `>=` tie-break
picks the later argument. Teams in the same race are therefore ranked against each other on
different scales. [Certain] on the mechanism; the specific per-team split depends on which
predictions root is live.

**3. Malformed rows are dropped silently and can collapse a race to a hardcoded 0.5.** A row with
position 0, a negative position, a null position, or no `team` key is skipped with no log. If that
leaves one team, `score_teams_from_actual_rows` returns `{team: 0.5}` — a real race result becomes
"exactly average" and enters the season-form series. Related: an **unmapped team name is kept as its
own team**, takes a rank slot, and shifts every real team's score — adding one unknown name moved
Ferrari 0.667 -> 0.750 and Williams 0.333 -> 0.250 (0.32s). The 2026 alias map resolves 28 of 32
plausible broadcast/FastF1 name variants; the misses are `Cadillac F1 Team`, `Mercedes-AMG`,
`McLaren Formula 1 Team`, `General Motors`. `Cadillac F1 Team` is the live risk — Cadillac is the new
2026 entry and its canonical FastF1 string is not pinned. Same class as the Sao Paulo accented-key
defect already recorded on 2026-08-01.

**4. Latent, not currently biting: recency weights are indexed by list position, not race number.**
`_get_saved_actual_observations` skips races where a team has no score, and weights are
`arange(1, len+1) ** exponent`, so a team that missed a race has every later observation weighted as
if one race earlier. All 11 teams are scored in every available 2026 race, so it does not fire today;
at exponent 0.3 the error would be ~1.1 percentage points, and it grows with the exponent.

**5. Reported DNF probability is confined to [0.150, 0.238] and saturates.** With
`dnf_probability_shrinkage_lambda: 0.25` and `dnf_probability_base_rate: 0.20`, simulated risks of
0.35, 0.60 and 1.00 all report 0.238 — a car certain to retire and a car at the cap are
indistinguishable — while a car at zero simulated risk reports 15.0%. The finish order is sampled
from the unshrunk rates, so the displayed number and the simulation disagree by construction.
Unchanged in this pass; recorded for the fix.

**Ranking.** Fix 1 and 2 before touching any weighting lever again; both are larger than every knob
measured to date. 3 is cheap and should log rather than fail silently. 4 is a comment. 5 is a
separate output-layer decision.

## 2026-09-05: season-form construct defects fixed — `adopted` (mechanism), and lead #1 measured

Follow-up to the 2026-09-04 stress pass. Three of its five findings were correctness defects with no
calibration judgment in them and are fixed here. The two that are model decisions are recorded below
with numbers but NOT adopted.

**Fixed 1 — teams in the same race were scored on different constructs.**
`_get_current_season_observations` returned whichever of `live` (telemetry/position pace), `saved`
(rank) or `replayed` was longest, and it ran once per team. On the stored 2026 payload the live and
saved constructs disagree by a mean of 0.098 team-strength units (0.38s) and a max of 0.308 (1.20s,
Audi; Williams 1.11s), and McLaren resolved to `saved` while the other ten teams resolved to `live`
because its two lists were both length 1 and the `>=` tie-break picked the later argument. The source
is now resolved ONCE for the whole field by total coverage summed across every team, memoized per
`(target_year, race_name)`, ties breaking `replayed > saved > live`. A team absent from the chosen
source falls back to the preseason baseline rather than silently reading a different scale.

**Fixed 2 — unmapped team names took a rank slot; malformed rows fabricated a score.**
`score_teams_from_actual_rows` kept any name that failed to resolve, so it consumed a rank position
and shifted every real team: one unknown name moved Ferrari 0.667 -> 0.750 and Williams 0.333 ->
0.250 (0.32s at the race slope). Unknown teams are now excluded and logged; if every row fails to
resolve the call logs ERROR and returns `{}` rather than producing a garbage field. Rows with an
invalid position are still dropped but counted and logged. The single-resolvable-team path returned
a fabricated `{team: 0.5}`, turning one real race result into "exactly average" inside the
season-form series; it now returns `{}`. Verified empirically: adding an unknown team now leaves
every known team's score bit-identical. Four missing 2026 aliases were added (`Cadillac F1 Team`,
`Mercedes-AMG`, `McLaren Formula 1 Team`, `General Motors`) — 32 of 32 plausible FastF1/broadcast
variants now resolve, up from 28. Same class as the Sao Paulo accented-key defect of 2026-08-01.

**Fixed 3 — recency weights were indexed by list position, not race number**, so a team that missed
a race had every later observation weighted as if one race earlier. Saved and replayed observations
now carry a race ordinal from `_get_race_order_map`; `live` has no race labels and keeps index
weighting, documented rather than invented.

**The first attempt at fix 3 inverted the thing it was correcting, and review caught it.** The
fallback for a race missing from the order map was `len(observations) + 1` — the running count,
unrelated to the real race number. For a team whose first scored race is R5 when the newest race is
unmapped, that produced ordinals `[5, 6, 3]` and weights `0.343 / 0.362 / 0.294` at exponent 0.3:
**the newest race became the least weighted.** A mid-season join with an earlier gap gave `[5, 2, 7]`.
Reachable here, not theoretical — the schedule loader logs `Supplemented 2026 schedule with local
fallback races: ['Emilia Romagna Grand Prix']`, and the Sao Paulo accent defect is the same class.
The fallback is now relative to the last emitted ordinal with a `<=` clamp, which also repairs a
race that is in the map but arrives out of order. Six adversarial cases pass, including
all-unmapped and duplicate-accented-slug.

**Lead #1 measured, not adopted: does a TRUE margin construct beat rank?** The earlier attempts were
invalid because `team_strength_same_session` is itself rank. Using `team_target_s` (real seconds gap
to field median) as the predictor, walk-forward, recency exponent 0.3, paired bootstrap:

| season | race | qualifying |
|---|---|---|
| 2026 | +15.7% (95% CI [+0.005,+0.202], significant) | +23.0% (CI [+0.058,+0.209], significant) |
| 2025 | -8.8% (significant, margin WORSE) | +1.5% (ns) |
| 2024 | -0.6% (ns) | +2.0% (ns) |

Blend sweep (w=0 pure rank, w=1 pure margin), best w per season:

| | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| race | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.25 | 0.0 | **1.0** |
| qualifying | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.75 | 0.75 | **1.0** |

**Qualifying margin wins or ties in 4 of 5 seasons — not an era artifact.** Race margin helps only in
2026 and loses in 2022/2023/2025; the regulation-break rule makes those seasons inadmissible against
a 2026 calibration, which also means the only support is 11 rounds. Separately, the pure
representation cost of rank was measured by round-tripping each 2026 session's real gaps through the
rank score and back: **0.605s RMS race / 0.522s qualifying**, worst 2.019s, against a 3.897s field
span, with a constant assigned adjacent-team gap of 0.476s versus a real median of 0.302s (p10
0.058s) — the model's gap exceeds 4x reality in 22% of adjacent pairs. For scale, the recency
exponent change adopted 2026-09-04 is worth 0.019s.

**These numbers are indicative, not adoption-grade.** They come from a standalone walk-forward
harness, not a rebuilt baseline over three seeds. They justify opening the margin refit; they do not
license adopting it. The prerequisite remains refitting `team_strength_seconds_mapping` with a
margin-native predictor, since the shipped slope was fitted with rank on the x-axis.

**Not changed, deliberately.** The reported DNF probability band `[0.150, 0.238]` and its
disagreement with the unshrunk simulation are an output-layer calibration decision needing a Brier
rescore, not a bug fix; `dnf_probability_shrinkage_lambda` and `dnf_probability_base_rate` were left
alone. Two lower-severity couplings are noted but untouched: the field source cache is keyed on
`(target_year, race_name)` and does not include `self.teams` or replay state, and
`_resolve_saved_actual_races_completed` still derives the completed-race count from live payload
state independently of which source the resolver picked.

## 2026-09-07: the qualifying matched-pair gate — defect confirmed, `worse` fix rejected

Two findings. A stated defect in the prediction fix plan is **falsified**; a real, separate
defect is **confirmed and quantified**; the obvious fix for it is measured and **loses**.

### The falsified one: driver ratings do not carry a per-team offset into qualifying

The plan opened with "`quali_rating_mu_s` carries a per-team offset it is not supposed to
have", backed by a regression of team-level PRE qualifying error on that offset with slope
-11.9 positions/second and r² 0.60 over the last three rounds.

**The qualifying prediction path already centres that field per team.**
`qualifying_preparation.py:807` calls `center_rating_mu_by_team(all_drivers,
field="quali_rating_mu_s")` unconditionally, once, after every driver record in the field is
built. Its only consumer is `_resolve_team_strength_signal`
(`qualifying_simulation.py:378`). The value reaching the qualifying score therefore has a
per-team mean of exactly zero.

This is the surviving half of `93bfbeb0`. The 2026-08-03 `worse` verdict reverted the
**fit-time** centring inside `attach_driver_rating_mus` plus the mapping refit; the
**prediction-time** centring was never reverted. Reading that entry as "centring is already
rejected" is wrong.

Checked for escape hatches, all closed on production state of 2026-09-06:

- all 11 teams have two finite values, so the `len(values) >= 2` guard never binds
- all 29 drivers in the payload return a complete four-field state from
  `read_driver_seconds_state`, so no driver is silently excluded from the centring
- `qualifying_mixin.py:620` is the only construction site for `all_drivers`; every
  downstream stage reuses `prepared["all_drivers"]`

The -11.9 slope is measuring a correlate, most plausibly team pace itself, since drivers in
fast cars carry faster seconds ratings. Three of the plan's four P0 work items depended on
the offset reaching the score and are retired.

Noted, not chased: `race_rating_mu_s` is never centred at all
(`race/preparation_flow.py:506,658`). Qualifying and race treat the same construct
differently. Race PRE MAE did not degrade, so there is no symptom yet.

### The confirmed one: qualifying observations are gated in a way that tracks team pace

`quali_rating_observations` spans 3 to 18 across the 2026 field while
`race_rating_observations` spans 10 to 17. The gate is
`MatchedLapConfig.min_matched_pairs_quali = 3`: `_qualifying_pair_rows` drops a whole
team-session below it, and `aggregate_matched_teammate_laps` drops it again. A team
eliminated in Q1 has one common segment and few timed laps, so it clears three matched pairs
far less often than a team whose drivers both reach Q3.

Extracted all 2026 qualifying sessions (`build_matched_lap_observations.py --years 2026`,
offline, 12 rounds x 11 teams = 132 team-sessions). `insufficient_matched_pairs` is 27 of 29
skips. Distribution of `candidate_matched_pairs`:

| pairs | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| team-sessions | 4 | 2 | **23** | 55 | 42 | 4 | 2 |

23 of 132 sit at exactly two pairs, one short of the gate.

The replay harness reproduces this end to end. `driver_update_trace.json` from a baseline
replay, counting qualifying update events against events that actually moved `mu`:

| team | events | moved mu |
|---|---|---|
| Aston Martin | 18 | **3** |
| Cadillac | 17-18 | 6 |
| Williams | 17 | 7 |
| Haas | 18 | 11 |
| McLaren | 18 | **18** |

Aston Martin loses 15 of 18 qualifying observations. McLaren loses none. The replay's final
driver state matches production exactly, so the harness is a faithful instrument for this.

### The fix that loses: `min_matched_pairs_quali` 3 -> 2

**Baseline** `757087f3` plus uncommitted season-form work, rebuilt from preseason with
`replay_historical_checkpoints.py --year 2026 --overwrite`, 13 rounds. Candidate identical
except the one constant.

| checkpoint | gate 3 | gate 2 |
|---|---|---|
| **all** | **2.3363** | **2.3931** |
| PRE | 2.5728 | 2.6141 |
| FP1 | 2.3959 | 2.4439 |
| FP2 | 2.1775 | 2.2738 |
| FP3 | 1.8831 | 1.9324 |
| SQ | 2.4545 | 2.6147 |

Mean delta **+0.0633 positions**, 95% bootstrap CI **[+0.0062, +0.1204]**, excludes zero.
Paired split 12 better / 23 worse / 11 tied over 46 common checkpoints. Every checkpoint
degrades. Race is `noise`: -0.0179, CI [-0.0930, +0.0562].

**The delta is not run-to-run variance.** Australian Grand Prix is round 1, so both arms enter
it with identical state, and all four of its checkpoints produced byte-identical prediction
payloads across the two runs. The pipeline is deterministic given equal state — qualifying
seeds from `sha256(f"{self.seed}:{year}:{race_name}:{stage}:{is_sprint}")` — so a repeat
baseline was not needed to establish the floor.

**The change did what it was designed to do and still lost.** Coverage equalised: Aston Martin
3 -> 13 observations, Cadillac 6 -> 15, Williams 7 -> 15, Haas 11 -> 17.

**Why it lost.** The recovered observations are not weak evidence being safely down-weighted;
they are over-weighted noise. Measured before scoring, on all 487 two-subsets of the 103
accepted sessions with n >= 3 pairs:

- a 2-pair median differs from the same session's full-n median by mean 0.235s, median
  0.120s, p90 0.512s, max 2.623s
- signed error is unbiased in aggregate at -0.010s, so this is variance, not skew
- bootstrap SE at n=2 averages 0.220s against that 0.235s mean error — right magnitude — but
  the calibration ratio |err|/SE has **median 1.20** where a correct 1-sigma gives 0.674, so
  **the SE understates uncertainty by roughly 1.5-2x**, with 7% of subsets beyond z > 3
- the 0.02s SE floor binds in only 9.4% of subsets, so it is not the mechanism

Confirmed in the replay: effective qualifying updates rose 272 -> 362, and mean |mu movement|
per update rose **0.0626s -> 0.0784s**, up 25%. Correctly down-weighted evidence moves
ratings less per update; this moved them more. Posterior sigma collapsed field-wide including
for teams that gained nothing — McLaren 0.031 -> 0.023, Mercedes 0.040 -> 0.020, VER 0.047 ->
0.027 — and two teammate orderings flipped sign, Haas OCO -0.109 -> +0.110 and RB LAW -0.074
-> +0.057.

The gate is a crude but load-bearing noise filter. Its *incidence* is biased against slow
teams; removing it is worse than keeping it.

**Verdict: `worse`.** Reverted, source unchanged.

**Test suite did not catch this.** 325 passed, 1 skipped in the `ilmnop` chunk with the change
applied. `tests/test_matched_lap_extractor.py` parameterises `min_matched_pairs_quali`
explicitly at 1, 2 and 3, so the default moving is invisible to it. Nothing in the suite
guards a calibration regression of this shape.

### Still open

The coverage defect is unfixed. The one arm the evidence points at is gate 2 with an honest
low-n SE, since the measured failure is specifically that the SE is under-dispersed at n=2.
That introduces a new tuning constant and must clear the "reproduce it by scaling a shipped
constant" check before it is believed. Not attempted here.

Second, smaller, untested: `_selected_qualifying_matches` iterates Q3, Q2, Q1 and `break`s as
soon as the accumulated count reaches the gate, so a team with three Q3 pairs discards its Q2
and Q1 pairs unread. This cannot help Q1-only teams and so cannot fix the bias, but it means
well-covered teams update from less evidence than exists. Separate arm, not bundled.

## 2026-09-07: P1 deployment construct — `never activated`, and the premise is wrong for the live path

`score_teams_from_actual_rows` (`src/predictors/baseline/data_support.py`) was changed from rank
among teams present (`1.0 - rank_index / (team_count - 1)`) to the fixed-scale margin construct that
`updater_flow._build_position_fallback_race_pace` already uses
(`clip(1.0 - (mean_position - 1) / (field_size - 1), 0, 1)`, field size from cars that entered).

Scored against the same preseason-rebuilt baseline, 13 rounds of 2026:

**All 46 paired checkpoints tied exactly. 0 better, 0 worse, 46 tied. Mean delta +0.0000.**

### Why: the changed path never runs in the current season

`_resolve_field_observation_source` picks one source for the whole field by total observation
coverage. The replay log resolves **`live` in 12 of 13 rounds**, with coverage climbing 21 (Japan) to
130 (Italy). The one exception is the season opener, which resolves to `replayed` with coverage **0** —
no observations at all, so every team falls back to the preseason baseline and the changed function
still contributes nothing.

Production is the same: `current_season_performance` carries 12-13 observations for every team,
**total live coverage 141**, which saved or replayed cannot beat.

`live` is only a candidate when `target_year == loaded_season_year`. So the rank path runs for
historical backtests of other seasons and, in principle, very early in a season before live coverage
accumulates — not for current-season prediction, which is what the product serves.

### The consequence for the plan

P1 opens with "Team strength is a rank statistic end to end." **That is false for the current-season
deployment path.** The source that actually feeds team strength is `live`, whose values come from
telemetry pace or from `_build_position_fallback_race_pace` — and that function is already
margin-preserving, with a docstring making the anti-rank argument verbatim. The deployment half of P1
was fixing a fallback nobody reaches.

What remains true, and is now the whole of P1: the **calibration** construct is still rank.
`team_strength_same_session` ranks lap-time medians and is what
`team_strength_seconds_mapping` was fitted against — qualifying slope 2.76281, race 3.89727. The
0.605s RMS round-trip representation error and the endpoint saturation (fastest team pinned at 1.0 in
11 of 11 rounds while its real margin varies 1.040s in qualifying and 1.089s in race) are both
properties of that construct, and both stand.

**This exposes a live units mismatch that no one has measured.** The mapping is fitted with rank on
the x-axis and is fed, at prediction time, `live` values that are margin-preserving rather than rank.
Those are different distributions on a shared 0-1 scale. The plan warned about exactly this class of
error for a margin refit; it is already present in the shipped configuration, in the opposite
direction.

### Verdict and disposition

**`never activated`** for the 2026 prediction path — untested, not neutral. Arm B (the same construct
paired with a mapping refitted on it, slopes x1.153 race and x1.158 qualifying) was cancelled once
Arm A returned identical numbers, because it would measure the same inactivity.

The change itself is correct and makes the two season-form paths agree, which was the point. But it
is **not** inert everywhere: historical backtests of other seasons resolve to saved/replayed and DO
use this function, so keeping it would change `scripts/backtest_2025_season.py` results in a way this
session did not measure. **Reverted** rather than left unmeasured on the strength of a 2026 replay
that never called it. The construct inconsistency between the two season-form paths therefore stands
as a known, documented gap; the fix is recorded here for whoever measures it on the path where it
actually runs.

### The live units mismatch, measured and dismissed

This entry initially proposed that the mapping is fitted on rank but fed margin-preserving `live`
values, making the shipped configuration carry a units error. **Measured, and it does not.** The 141
live observations in production against the 196 rank rows the mapping was fitted on:

| | n | mean | sd | min | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| live (reaches the mapping) | 141 | 0.5041 | 0.3128 | 0.0 | 1.0 |
| rank (mapping was fitted on) | 196 | 0.5000 | 0.3233 | 0.0 | 1.0 |

sd ratio 0.968, mean shift +0.0041 units — +0.011s in qualifying, +0.016s in race. Immaterial. The
hypothesis is dead; the shipped mapping is fed a distribution that matches what it was fitted on.

Note what that also means: the `live` source spans exactly 0.0 to 1.0, so it **saturates at the
endpoints the same way rank does**. Being margin-preserving in construction did not stop it
compressing the ends.

### Next, if P1 continues

The remaining lever is the one the fold evidence supports and neither path implements: a construct
carrying real lap-time seconds rather than positions, on both the calibration and the live side,
with the mapping refitted to match. On identical information a lap-time margin beats a lap-time rank
by +0.157 R2 in 2026 qualifying and +0.122 in race, and position-based constructs sit 0.10 to 0.25 R2
below lap-time ones regardless of whether they rank or preserve margin. That is the size of the prize
and it is larger than anything measured in this session. It needs a per-team green-flag seconds
source anchored on the field median (`scripts/extract_team_race_pace.py` anchors on the fastest team
and has no qualifying equivalent), so it is real work, not a constant change.

## 2026-09-12: the measurement protocol was unrunnable, and the seed floor it mandated was never measured

Not a model change. This entry corrects how results in this file are produced, and it
revises two verdicts recorded a few days earlier.

### Root cause: the protocol pointed at a harness that no longer exists

The **Measurement protocol** section prescribed `scripts/run_challenger_research_walk_forward.py`
with 3 seeds from `DEFAULT_REPLAY_SEEDS`. Verified 2026-09-12: that script does not exist,
`DEFAULT_REPLAY_SEEDS` appears in **zero** Python files, and two of the data paths it named
(`data/historical_replay/2026/prediction_cache`, `research_backend_state/`) are gone. Every
other script named across this file and `MODEL_PROMOTION.md` still exists, so this was one
rotted section rather than general drift.

The consequence is the part that matters. The rule that made results trustworthy — score
across 3 seeds — pointed at something nobody could run, so work fell back to
`scripts/replay_historical_checkpoints.py`, which **had no seed support at all** and always
ran seed 42. Every verdict produced that way, including all of 2026-09-04 through
2026-09-07, rests on a single draw of the simulator's randomness.

### The seed floor, measured

Identical code, seed 42 against seed 43, 13 rounds of 2026, 46 paired checkpoints:

| target | metric | mean delta | 95% CI |
|---|---|---|---|
| qualifying | overall_mae | -0.0122 | [-0.0439, +0.0187] |
| qualifying | correlation | -0.0007 | [-0.0039, +0.0024] |
| race | overall_mae | +0.0342 | [-0.0184, +0.0868] |
| race | correlation | -0.0009 | [-0.0076, +0.0059] |
| sprint race | overall_mae | -0.0251 | [-0.1163, +0.0609] |

Changing nothing but the seed moves qualifying MAE by 0.012 and race MAE by 0.034. Per
checkpoint the deltas have sd 0.11 (qualifying) and 0.18 (race), and the seed change alters
the score on 30 of 46 qualifying and 41 of 46 race checkpoints.

**A qualifying MAE change under ~0.045 positions, or a race MAE change under ~0.087, is not
resolvable on a single seed pair.** A number of deltas recorded in this file are smaller
than that.

### MAE is the wrong primary metric

Resolving power over the same 46 checkpoints — 95% CI half-width on a paired delta divided
by the metric's own spread, lower is finer:

| metric | detectable / spread |
|---|---|
| **correlation** | **0.030** |
| overall_mae | 0.063 |
| top_3_pct | 0.076 |
| within_3 | 0.093 |
| top_10_pct | 0.160 |
| within_1 | 0.172 |
| exact_accuracy | 0.266 |

Correlation resolves about twice as finely as MAE **and** is seed-stable. MAE is also
discretised to integer positions: comparing `757087f3` against its parent, predictions
differed on **40 of 46** checkpoints while MAE was identical on 13 — and **7 of those 13 had
genuinely different predicted orders that MAE could not distinguish**. MAE reports "tied"
for changes that happened.

### Tooling added

- `scripts/replay_historical_checkpoints.py` takes `--seed` (default 42, so existing
  behaviour is unchanged); the seed is threaded through `run_historical_checkpoint_replay`
  and `_build_race_checkpoint_record` into `Baseline2026Predictor`.
- `scripts/compare_replay_arms.py` compares replay roots from their `accuracy_snapshot`
  artifacts, reports `correlation` first, and gates every result against a measured floor
  supplied as `--seed-floor <root> <root>`. Without a floor it warns and refuses to emit
  `unresolvable`. The floor threshold is the **widest absolute bound of the seed pair's
  confidence interval**, not its point estimate: one seed pair's shift is a single draw, and
  gating on the point estimate lets noise-sized effects through as real.
- Its verdicts distinguish `unresolvable (below seed floor)` — nothing was learned — from
  `identical (never activated)` — every checkpoint tied, so the change provably did nothing.
  Collapsing the second into the first would have hidden the most useful finding of
  2026-09-07.

### Two verdicts revised

Re-scored with the floor applied, qualifying, 46 paired checkpoints:

| arm | correlation delta | CI | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| seed floor (42 vs 43) | -0.0007 | [-0.0039, +0.0024] | noise |
| gate 2, lambda 1 | **-0.0051** | **[-0.0095, -0.0009]** | **worse** |

**Revision 1 — the gate-2 loss is confirmed, not weak.** The 2026-09-07 entry called
`min_matched_pairs_quali` 3 -> 2 `worse` on a qualifying MAE delta of +0.0633. When the seed
floor was first measured that looked marginal, because +0.0633 is only about five times the
floor's point estimate and their intervals overlap. On `correlation` it is unambiguous:
-0.0051 with a CI excluding zero, clearing the correlation floor of 0.0039, and corroborated
by MAE (+0.0633), `exact_accuracy` (-3.85) and `top_10_pct` (-1.96). **The `worse` verdict
stands and is better evidenced than when it was written.**

**Revision 2 — lambda 2 and lambda 4 were recorded as `noise`; they are `unresolvable`.**
Both sit below the floor, so those runs did not show the recovered observations are
worthless — they showed the comparison could not tell. The P0 closure still holds, because
the response is monotone toward the baseline with no interior optimum and lambda 1 is
genuinely worse, but the supporting rows are weaker than the original entry implied.

### Not done

`src/analysis/promotion_gate.py` still scores on MAE alone and takes no floor, so the
requirement added to `MODEL_PROMOTION.md` is enforced by the person running the promotion,
not by code. `scripts/generate_evaluation_report.py` and the dashboard were deliberately
left on MAE: changing the primary metric there reaches the live product, and the verdicts
that matter are made in the comparison tool.

## Adding an entry

Keep it to what a future reader needs to trust or discard the result:

- what the variant changes, in one line — the thesis, not the implementation
- the champion baseline it was measured against, by commit
- the protocol, if it differs from the one above
- the numbers, including how many events went each way — a mean delta alone
  hides a 4–3 split
- a verdict from the table at the top
- for `never activated` or `refused`, the disclosed reason verbatim

A result with no baseline recorded is not reusable later. That is the single
most common way this kind of log goes stale.
