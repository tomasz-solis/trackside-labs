# Model Promotion Gates

This project treats model changes as challengers until they prove they help.
That matters because reset-year signals are easy to double count: a testing
team seed, residual model, and calibration layer can each look reasonable alone
but regress when stacked.

## Current Release Posture

Active model version: `3.0`.

`3.0` is a mechanism change, not a recalibration, which is why it takes a major
version. Position changes in the race simulation previously happened by free
crossover on cumulative lap time: a quicker car moved ahead whether or not the
pass model fired, and 98.4% of simulated position changes at Monaco involved no
pass event at all. They are now gated on a completed pass, so behaviour before
and after is not comparable rather than merely differently tuned.

Three inputs were refitted to measurements in the same release: per-team race
pace now comes from measured green-flag lap times rather than classified
results, `skill_improvement_max` was fitted to the observed team mate lap-time
gap, and a penalised driver is no longer re-anchored to the grid slot a steward
put him in. See `docs/MODEL_LEDGER.md` for the numbers.

`2.3` kept the existing champion predictor in production and added
target-specific shadow challengers. The challenger outputs are recorded for
audit; they are not dashboard-facing promotion decisions. Note that the doc
recorded `2.3` while `config/default.yaml` carried `2.4` — the two had already
drifted before this release.

Targets are evaluated separately:

- `main_qualifying`
- `grand_prix_race`
- `sprint_qualifying`
- `sprint_race`

The current rule is to revisit promotion after races 8, 9, and 10. A challenger
may improve one target without being promoted to every target.

## Runtime Safety

Production defaults stay conservative:

- residual models are disabled by default,
- residual models are skipped when the active team seed is `testing_model`,
- stacking with `testing_model` requires an explicit ablation opt-in,
- conformal calibration is evaluated as interval calibration, not as a ranking fix.
- shadow challengers are saved as diagnostics and must not overwrite champion
  predictions without a promotion decision.

## Production Readiness Gate

Implementation: `scripts/generate_evaluation_report.py`.

The production gate writes `production_gate` into
`data/evaluation/2026_evaluation_report.json` and mirrors the result in
`docs/MODEL_CALIBRATION.md`.

The gate requires:

- a fresh evaluation report after the latest completed race weekend,
- at least 5 scored completed race weekends,
- positive qualifying MAE improvement over previous-race naive baseline,
- positive race MAE improvement over previous-race naive baseline,
- empirical qualifying interval coverage near the nominal 90% band,
- no unresolved high-miss systematic-bias bucket.

Run it with:

```bash
make evaluation-gate
```

Candidate and shadow diagnostics:

```bash
make candidate-audit
make shadow-challenger-audit
```

## Promotion Gate

Implementation: `src/analysis/promotion_gate.py`.

A challenger must pass all of these before it is treated as stackable:

- combined race + qualifying central MAE improves enough to matter,
- race MAE does not regress beyond tolerance,
- qualifying MAE does not regress beyond tolerance,
- winner accuracy does not drop,
- top-3 accuracy does not drop beyond tolerance,
- race MAE is not worse on more weekends than it improves,
- qualifying MAE is not worse on more weekends than it improves,
- a seed floor is supplied, and at least one target's MAE improvement exceeds it.

The gate returns both a boolean and concrete block reasons. Reports should show
those reasons instead of reducing the result to a vague pass/fail.

### The seed floor, added 2026-09-12, enforced in code 2026-09-19

Every bullet above is a MAE comparison, and **MAE cannot resolve the size of
change this project usually tests**. Measured on 2026-09-12 by replaying the same
code at seed 42 and seed 43 over 13 rounds of 2026: qualifying MAE moved -0.0122
(95% CI [-0.0439, +0.0187]) and race MAE moved +0.0342 (CI [-0.0184, +0.0868])
with **no model change at all**. So a qualifying MAE gain under ~0.045 positions,
or a race MAE gain under ~0.087, is indistinguishable from the simulator's own
randomness.

Two further defects in MAE as a gate metric, both measured the same day: it
discretises to integer positions, so in one real comparison 7 of 46 checkpoints
had **different predicted orders and identical MAE**; and it resolves about half
as finely as `correlation`, which is also seed-stable (its aggregate shifts
0.0007 across a seed change while still responding on 41 of 46 checkpoints).

**Requirement.** Before a challenger is promoted, measure the seed floor for the
arms being compared and confirm the improvement exceeds it. Use:

```bash
uv run python scripts/replay_historical_checkpoints.py --year 2026 --overwrite \
  --seed 43 --output-root data/historical_replay_seed43
uv run python scripts/compare_replay_arms.py --baseline <baseline> \
  --seed-floor <baseline> data/historical_replay_seed43 --candidate <candidate>
```

`compare_replay_arms.py` reports `correlation` first and labels a sub-floor
result `unresolvable` rather than `noise`, which are different findings — see
the verdict table in `docs/MODEL_LEDGER.md`.

**`src/analysis/promotion_gate.py` enforces this.** It takes
`seed_floor={"race_mae": ..., "qualifying_mae": ...}` and fails with "seed floor
not supplied; improvement unproven" when none is given. The floor must be
measured for the comparison being gated: the replay floor above belongs to the
13-round 2026 replay and does not transfer to other seasons or sample sizes.
`scripts/evaluate_testing_team_seed_model.py` runs its holdouts on one seed and
passes no floor, so every comparison it reports is blocked until a floor is
measured for it.

## Movement Diagnostics

Implementation: `src/analysis/component_diagnostics.py`.

Movement diagnostics compare:

```text
champion prediction -> challenger prediction -> actual result
```

per race, session, and driver. The report counts:

- moved closer,
- moved farther,
- unchanged,
- MAE before,
- MAE after,
- mean movement,
- mean reported residual or learned adjustment when available.

This is especially useful for residual models. If a residual model improves one
mean metric but moves most drivers farther from actual positions, it should not
be promoted.

## Adaptive Learning Gate

Implementation: `src/systems/systematic_learning.py`.

The learner updates only from usable actual outcomes. It skips:

- retrospective checkpoint reconstructions,
- duplicate run IDs,
- records with no actual results,
- records with too few overlapping drivers between prediction and actuals.

Skipped partial records do not mark the run ID as processed. If a complete
actual payload arrives later for the same run, it can still train the learner.

## Shadow Challenger Workflow

Implementation:

- `src/models/shadow_challenger.py`
- `scripts/audit_shadow_challengers.py`
- `scripts/audit_model_candidates.py`

Shadow challengers must use only prior completed actuals and current saved
champion predictions. Same-race actuals are leakage and must be excluded.

The audit reports:

- target-specific champion vs challenger MAE,
- number of comparable scored events,
- checkpoint MAE decay,
- best candidate family by target/session type.

## Research Workflow

1. Run the champion and challenger with isolated data roots.
2. Generate component ablations with `scripts/evaluate_testing_team_seed_model.py`.
3. Read the promotion gate and movement diagnostics together.
4. Read the model candidate and shadow challenger audits.
5. Keep exploratory artifacts out of ordinary code commits unless they are part
   of the release evidence.
6. Promote only the smallest component stack that passes across holdouts and the live slice.
