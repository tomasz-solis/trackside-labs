"""
Driver Characteristics Extraction - Global Teammate Network Ranking

Uses iterative global solver to calculate absolute driver ratings from
relative teammate comparisons. Like Elo/TrueSkill for F1.

Key improvements:
- No capping/manual overrides
- Solves teammate network globally (HAM vs RUS → both elite)
- Handles mid-season swaps
- Recency and confidence weighting
- Rookie penalties

USAGE:
