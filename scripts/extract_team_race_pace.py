"""Measure per-team race pace from cached FastF1 lap data.

``team_strength`` (see ``_get_current_season_observations`` in
``src/predictors/baseline/data_mixin.py``) is reconstructed from classified race
results, which conflate pace with reliability, strategy and luck. This script
measures pace directly from green-flag lap times instead, and writes it to
``data/processed/team_race_pace/<year>_team_race_pace.json`` for
``_resolve_team_pace_delta_seconds`` in ``src/utils/lap_by_lap_simulator.py`` to
prefer over the results-derived value.

Method, per race:
    - keep laps with ``TrackStatus == "1"`` (green flag), a valid ``LapTime``, and
      neither ``PitInTime`` nor ``PitOutTime`` set
    - per driver, take the median of those lap times; drop drivers with fewer
      than 10 qualifying laps
    - per team, take the median across its drivers
    - normalise: subtract the fastest team's value that race, giving a per-race
      gap in seconds (0.0 for the fastest team)

Per-race gaps are written under ``races`` so a forecast can average only the races
before its target; ``teams`` is the season average, kept for reading.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/extract_team_race_pace.py --year 2026
    uv run python scripts/extract_team_race_pace.py --year 2026 --dry-run
