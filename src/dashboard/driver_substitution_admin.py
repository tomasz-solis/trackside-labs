"""Operator-only editor for one race's driver substitutions.

A stand-in is confirmed days before the weekend and usually moves two drivers, not one:
the reserve takes the injured driver's seat and someone else takes the reserve's. Editing
``data/current_lineups.json`` would mean a commit and a redeploy for a change that lasts
one or two races, so substitutions are written to the runtime artifact store from here.

The whole chain is saved in one submit, deliberately. Half a chain seats one driver in two
cars, and saving swap-by-swap would reject every valid chain at its first step.

Access is gated by the same admin token as the grid-penalty editor: the dashboard is
public, and nothing here renders without it.
