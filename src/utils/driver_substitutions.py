"""Swap a race-weekend driver into another team's seat before prediction runs.

A driver misses a weekend (injury, illness, a mid-season drop) and a reserve or a
junior-team driver takes the seat, which usually pushes a second driver up the chain.
``data/current_lineups.json`` is one static season-wide file, so editing it means a
commit and a redeploy for a change that lasts one or two races, and it retroactively
mislabels driver-to-team attribution for every result already scored against it.

Substitutions are typed in per race instead, exactly like ``grid.penalties``: the
dashboard writes them to the runtime artifact store, the config file stays the fallback,
and the entry stops applying by itself once the next race is selected.

The map is flat and applied in one simultaneous pass, so a chain needs no ordering:
``{"HAD": "LAW", "LAW": "TSU"}`` over ``Red Bull: [VER, HAD]`` and ``RB: [LAW, LIN]``
gives ``Red Bull: [VER, LAW]`` and ``RB: [TSU, LIN]``.
