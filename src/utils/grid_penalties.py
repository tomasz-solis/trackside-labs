"""Apply post-qualifying grid penalties to the grid handed to race prediction.

Qualifying classification is not the starting grid: a driver who qualifies P3 and
takes a power-unit penalty is still classified P3 by the timing feed. Once the race
has run, ``fetch_actual_starting_grid`` reads the real grid from FastF1 and this
module stops mattering. Before it, there is no automated source: the stewards
publish decisions as PDFs on a Saturday night, so the drop is typed in by hand
against ``grid.penalties`` in the config.

The drop is applied here, to the race grid, and never to the qualifying prediction.
