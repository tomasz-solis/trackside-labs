"""Lap-by-lap Monte Carlo race simulation for 2026-style F1 weekends.

Race pace in F1 is path-dependent. The same car can win comfortably in clean
air, get trapped behind traffic, or lose a race to one badly timed safety car.
That is why this model uses Monte Carlo rather than a neat analytical formula:
pit timing, lap-one variance, tire warm-up, safety car timing, and overtaking
windows all interact in ways that are hard to compress without losing the feel
of an actual Sunday.

The code intentionally keeps those moving parts explicit. Grid position matters,
but it is not destiny. Faster cars can pass if the active-aero window opens,
fresh tires create short-lived undercut opportunities, and a chaotic race
should look different from a calm one. The production predictor
aggregates many runs rather than trusting one simulated race, which is the same
reason teams run thousands of strategy scenarios before a grand prix.
